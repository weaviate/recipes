| Classification | Learn how to use KNN and zero-shot classification |
| Multi-Tenancy | Store tenants on separate shards for complete data isolation |
| Multi-Vector Embeddings | Use Weaviate with powerful ColBERT-style embeddings to improve search results |
| Product Quantization | Compress vector embeddings and reduce the memory footprint using Weaviate's PQ feature |
| Evaluation | Evaluate your search system |

## Weaviate Services üß∞
| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Weaviate Embeddings | [Weaviate Embeddings](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/embeddings) enables you to generate embeddings directly from a [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) database instance. |
