## Weaviate Features 🔧

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Similarity Search | Use Weaviate's `nearText` operator to run semantic search queries (broken out by model provider) |
| Hybrid Search | Use Weaviate's `hybrid` operator to run hybrid search queries (broken out by model provider) |
| Generative Search | Build a simple RAG workflow using Weaviate's `.generate` (broken out by model provider) |
| Filters | Narrow down your search results by adding filters to your queries |
| Reranking | Add reranking to your pipeline to improve search results (broken out by model provider) |
| Media Search | Use Weaviate's `nearImage` and `nearVideo` operator to search using images and videos |
| Classification | Learn how to use KNN and zero-shot classification |
| Multi-Tenancy | Store tenants on separate shards for complete data isolation |
| Multi-Vector Embeddings | Use Weaviate with powerful ColBERT-style embeddings to improve search results |
| Product Quantization | Compress vector embeddings and reduce the memory footprint using Weaviate's PQ feature |
| Evaluation | Evaluate your search system |

## Weaviate Services 🧰
| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Agents | Use Weaviate's inherent agents like the `QueryAgent` & `TransformationAgent` |
| Weaviate Embeddings | [Weaviate Embeddings](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/embeddings) enables you to generate embeddings directly from a [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) database instance. |
