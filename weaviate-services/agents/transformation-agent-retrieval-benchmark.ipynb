      "AI Agents are semi- or fully- autonomous systems that make use of LLMs as the brain of the operation. This allows you to build applications that are able to handle complex user queries that may need to access multiple data sources. And, over the past few years we’ve started to build such applications thanks to more and more powerful LLMs capable of function calling, frameworks that simplify the development process and more.\u001b[0m\n",

      "**With the Query Agent, we aim to provide an agent that is inherently capable of handling complex queries over multiple Weaviate collections.** The agent understands the structure of all of your collections, so knows when to run searches, aggregations or even both at the same time for you. Often, AI agents are described as LLMs that have access to various tools (adding more to its capabilities), which are also able to make a plan, and reason about the response. Our Query Agent is an AI agent that is provided access to multiple Weaviate collections within a cluster. Depending on the user’s query, it will be able to decide which collection or collections to perform searches on.\u001b[0m\n",

While some may require us to do semantic search using embeddings over a dataset, other queries may require us to make [aggregations](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/aggregate) (such as counting objects, calculating the average value of a property and so on).

      "The Weaviate Query Agent represents a significant step forward in making vector databases more accessible and powerful. By combining the capabilities of LLMs with Weaviate's own search and aggregation features, we've created a tool that can handle complex queries across multiple collections while maintaining context and supporting multiple languages. The resulting agent can be used on its own, as well as within a larger agentic or multi-agent application.\u001b[0m\n",
