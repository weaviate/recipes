      "\n",
      "1. **Narwhal**: The narwhal is a marine mammal known for its long, spiral tusk, which can reach lengths of up to 10 feet. In medieval times, this tusk was often sold as a \"unicorn horn\" and was believed to possess magical properties. The resemblance of the narwhal's tusk to the mythical unicorn's horn led to the association between the two, as people were fascinated by the idea of unicorns and sought to find evidence of their existence in the natural world.\n",

      "2. **Walrus**: While the walrus does not have a direct connection to unicorns like the narwhal, its large tusks and unique appearance may have contributed to some fantastical interpretations. The walrus's tusks, which can be quite prominent, might have sparked the imagination of those who were already inclined to believe in mythical creatures. Additionally, the walrus's size and distinctive features could have led to comparisons with other legendary animals, including unicorns, in folklore and storytelling.\n",
