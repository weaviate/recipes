Whether your goal is to construct a Home Feed interface for users or to pair with search queries, Ref2Vec provides a strong foundation to enable Recommendation with fairly low overhead. For example, it can achieve personalized re-ranking, also known as a session-based recommendation, without persisting user data over a long sequence of interactions. A new user could have personalization available after a few interactions on the app which will help them quickly settle in and feel at home, helping to overcome what is known as the cold-start problem.\"\n",

This enables Weaviate to rapidly generate accurate and up-to-date representations of users based on recent interactions. For instance, if a user clicks on multiple shoe images in an e-commerce store, it's likely they're interested in seeing more shoes. Ref2Vec effectively captures this intuition by generating vectors that aggregate each User's interactions with other classes. The adjacent animation illustrates this concept in action, using real-world e-commerce image interactions as an example.\n",

And by doing so, the resulting recommendations can more closely match the User's product and style preferences. We envision Ref2Vec to have great potential in multiple application areas.
