The platform here is Windows and Mac, so compatible options would be useful.\n",

While it's PC-focused, maybe there are porting options available or different devices that can run it if the user has access to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, \"Black Book.\" This dark RPG is based on Slavic myths and played as a young sorceress. It involves card-based battles in a world with mythological creatures.
