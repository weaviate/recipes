      "<br> REVIEW I DID NOT EVEN HEAR THE END OF THE CD! Lisa Hampshire: I have had many years of only getting 3 or 4 hours of sleep a night, due to restlessness and an overactive mind I have tried numerous sleeping tablets and hot drinks but none have really made any difference Therefore I was willing to try anything - even a CD! As I lay awake sceptically listening I found that it wasn't just relaxing music but some actual good advice on relaxation techniques I tried putting these into practice and continued to listen to the CD the next thing I knew I was awake only an hour before my alarm was due to go off I would strongly recommend this product as an aid to sleep and relaxation.\n",
