In this article, we give you an overview of what Ref2Vec is and some examples in which it can add value such as recommendations or representing long objects. ## What is Ref2Vec? The name Ref2Vec is short for reference-to-vector, and it offers the ability to vectorize a data object with its cross-references to other objects. The Ref2Vec module currently holds the name ref2vec-**centroid** because it uses the average, or centroid vector, of the cross-referenced vectors to represent the **referencing** object.As you have seen above, we think Ref2Vec can add value for use cases such as recommendations, re-ranking, overcoming the cold start problem and representing long objects. We are also excited to see what you build with Ref2Vec, and excited to build on this module with its future iterations. Speaking of which, we have another blog post coming soon on the development directions of Ref2Vec for the future. We will discuss topics such as **collaborative filtering**, **multiple centroids**, **graph neural networks**, and more on **re-ranking** with Ref2Vec. Stay tuned! import WhatNext from '/_includes/what-next.mdx' <WhatNext />In other words, the User vector is being updated in real-time here to take into account their preferences and actions, which helps to produce more relevant results at speed. Another benefit of Ref2Vec is that this calculation is not compute-heavy, leading to low overhead. With Ref2Vec, you can use Weaviate to provide Recommendation with \"user-as-query\". This is a very common and powerful way to build Home Feed style features in apps. This can be done by sending queries like this to Weaviate: ```graphql { Get { Product ( nearObject: { id: \"8abc5-4d5...\" # id for the User object with vector defined by ref2vec-centroid } ) { product_name price } } } ``` This short query encapsulates the power of Ref2Vec.\n",
