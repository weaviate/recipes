    "## LLM Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an LLM metric to evaluate these systems along a weighted combination of (1) how detailed the responses are, (2) how well supported they are by the context, and (3) how well they align with a given ground truth answer to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our LLM metric is itself a 3-layer DSPy program:\n",

    "## Optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the `BootstrapFewShot` optimizer to bootstrap 2 synthetic input-output examples for each component in the 4 RAG programs, and then we will let the `BayesianSignatureOptimizer` loose on our most complex program the MultiHopRAGwithSummarizer."

[Score Rankers](#score-rankers)\\n\\n## Cross Encoders\\nCross Encoders are one of the most well known ranking models for content-based re-ranking. There is quite a collection of pre-trained cross encoders available on [sentence transformers](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_cross-encoders.html). We are currently envisioning interfacing cross encoders with Weaviate using the following syntax.', 'Bi-Encoders are fast, but are not as accurate as the expensive fisherman aka the Cross-Encoder. Cross-Encoders are time-consuming, like the fisherman who would need to limit the number of fishing rounds they could do. So we can chain those two methods behind each other (see Figure 5). First, you use a Bi-Encoder to retrieve a *list of result candidates*, then you use a Cross-Encoder on this list of candidates to pick out (or rerank) the most relevant results. This way, you benefit from the efficient retrieval method using Bi-Encoders and the high accuracy of the Cross-Encoder, so you can use this on large scale datasets!\\n\\n![Multistage search pipeline](./img/weaviate-pipeline-long.png)\\n\\n*Figure 5 - Multistage search pipeline using Weaviate*\\n\\n## Pre-trained Cross-Encoder models\\n\\nAs noted, Cross-Encoders can achieve high *in-domain* accuracy.', '![Cross-Encoder](./img/cross-encoder.png)\\n\\n*Figure 3 - Representation of a Cross-Encoder model*\\n\\n\\nIf a Cross-Encoder model is trained on a representative training set, it [achieves higher accuracy than Bi-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084). However, since you need to use the Cross-Encoder model during a search for every single data item in combination with the query, this method is very inefficient. For a real-life semantic search application – with thousands or millions of objects – this would be impractical, as it would take \"forever\" to perform the search. ## Combining Bi-Encoders and Cross-Encoders\\n\\nWe can combine the two methods to benefit from the strong points of both models!

The context mentions a specific syntax error in a GraphQL query, but it doesn't provide the actual query for us to examine directly. However, we can infer some information from the context that might help us understand the nature of the error. First, let's recall that n-gram matching is a method used to evaluate the similarity between strings by looking for contiguous sequences of words or phrases (n-grams) in both strings. In the context, it seems that the GraphQL query example contains a syntax error related to missing commas, which might affect the performance of n-gram matching.\n",

In this article, we give you an overview of what Ref2Vec is and some examples in which it can add value such as recommendations or representing long objects. ## What is Ref2Vec? The name Ref2Vec is short for reference-to-vector, and it offers the ability to vectorize a data object with its cross-references to other objects. The Ref2Vec module currently holds the name ref2vec-**centroid** because it uses the average, or centroid vector, of the cross-referenced vectors to represent the **referencing** object.', \"Although all the query does is provide the ID of the User object, Ref2Vec has done the hard work by inferring a centroid vector from the User's references to other vectors. And as the set of references continues to evolve, the Ref2Vec vectors will continue to evolve also, ensuring that the User vector remains up-to-date with their latest interests. Whether your goal is to construct a Home Feed interface for users or to pair with search queries, Ref2Vec provides a strong foundation to enable Recommendation with fairly low overhead. For example, it can achieve personalized re-ranking, also known as a session-based recommendation, without persisting user data over a long sequence of interactions. A new user could have personalization available after a few interactions on the app which will help them quickly settle in and feel at home, helping to overcome what is known as the cold-start problem.\", \"![Cross-reference](./img/Weaviate-Ref2Vec_1.png)\\n\\nRef2Vec gives Weaviate another way to vectorize a class, such as the User class, based on their relationships to other classes. This allows Weaviate to quickly create up-to-date representations of users based on their relationships such as recent interactions. If a user clicks on 3 shoe images on an e-commerce store, it is a safe bet that they want to see more shoes. Ref2Vec captures this intuition by calculating vectors that aggregate each User's interaction with another class. The below animation visualizes a real example of this in e-Commerce images.\", 'Ref2Vec in Weaviate is a module that utilizes cross-references to create user profiles and provide personalized recommendations. It works by inferring centroid vectors from user references, allowing for dynamic updates and personalized recommendations without persisting user data over long sequences of interactions.', 'Ref2Vec in Weaviate is a module that utilizes cross-references to vectorize data objects, representing the referencing object with the average vector of its cross-referenced vectors.

Another emerging development is the effectiveness of zero-shot re-ranking models. Weaviate currently offers 2 [re-ranking models from Cohere](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/reranker-cohere): `rerank-english-v2.0` and `rerank-multilingual-v2.0`. As evidenced from the name, these models mostly differ because of the training data used and the resulting multilingual capabilities.', '### rankedFusion\\n\\nThe `rankedFusion` algorithm is the original hybrid fusion algorithm that has been available since the launch of hybrid search in Weaviate. In this algorithm, each object is scored according to its position in the results for the given search, starting from the highest score for the top-ranked object and decreasing down the order. The total score is calculated by adding these rank-based scores from the vector and keyword searches. Now, let’s take a look at the newer `relativeScoreFusion` algorithm. ### relativeScoreFusion\\n\\nThe `relativeScoreFusion` algorithm was added in Weaviate version `1.20`.', 'Re-ranking is a necessary step when implementing hybrid search. The alpha parameter dictates the weighting of each algorithm and determines the re-ranking of the results. ## Weaviate UX\\nTo use hybrid search in Weaviate, you only need to confirm that you’re using Weaviate `v1.17` or a later version. You can run the hybrid queries in GraphQL or the other various client programming languages. There are five parameters needed to run the hybrid search query (some are optional):\\n* `hybrid`: shows that you want to use hybrid search\\n* `query`: search query\\n* `alpha`(optional): weighting for each search algorithm (alpha = 0 (sparse), alpha = 1 (dense), alpha = 0.5 (equal weight for sparse and dense))\\n* `vector` (optional): optional to supply your own vector\\n* `score`(optional): additional information on how much the sparse and dense method contributed to the result\\n\\nWith just a few lines of code, you can start using hybrid search.', 'Weaviate introduced the `relativeScoreFusion` algorithm in version `1.20` for hybrid search, along with re-ranking models from Cohere for improved search capabilities.', 'Weaviate has integrated re-ranking models from Cohere, including `rerank-english-v2.0` and `rerank-multilingual-v2.0`, which provide developers with off-the-shelf models for enhancing search capabilities in AI-powered applications.'],\n",

    "\n",
    "- A deduplication process was added, so that large WALs with a lot of updates (i.e. redundant data) could be reduced to only the necessary information. - The recovery process now runs in parallel. If there are multiple places that require recovery, they can each recover independently, without one recovery having to wait for the other. - A mechanism was added that flushes any memtable that has been idle (no writes) for 60s or more. In addition to speeding up the recovery, this change also ensures that no recovery is needed at all in many cases.»\n",
    "[2] «#### Problem\n",
    "If Weaviate encounters an unexpected crash, no data will be lost. To provide this guarantee, a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is in place. If a crash had occurred, the WAL is parsed at startup, and all previously unfinished operations are recovered, even if they were part of in-memory structures that had not yet been flushed. While this system is very safe, the recovery could be slow for several reasons:\n",

    "Context:\n",
    "[1] «#### Solution\n",
    "We addressed each of the points above individually and improved the overall MTTR substantially:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A deduplication process was added, so that large WALs with a lot of updates (i.e. redundant data) could be reduced to only the necessary information. - The recovery process now runs in parallel. If there are multiple places that require recovery, they can each recover independently, without one recovery having to wait for the other. - A mechanism was added that flushes any memtable that has been idle (no writes) for 60s or more. In addition to speeding up the recovery, this change also ensures that no recovery is needed at all in many cases.»\n",
    "[2] «#### Problem\n",
    "If Weaviate encounters an unexpected crash, no data will be lost. To provide this guarantee, a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is in place. If a crash had occurred, the WAL is parsed at startup, and all previously unfinished operations are recovered, even if they were part of in-memory structures that had not yet been flushed. While this system is very safe, the recovery could be slow for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unflushed memtables could become very large. This would lead to a lot of data that needs to be recovered after a crash\n",
    "- The recovery process was single-threaded.»\n",
    "[3] «#### Test\n",
    "We designed an extreme stress test that would represent the \"worst-case\" scenario for recovery. It has multiple very large, independent Write-Ahead Logs that required for recovery. Before, this could take many hours to recover, while now it takes only a few seconds. ### Full changelog\n",

    "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the syntax error in the GraphQL query example related to the evaluation of n-gram matches. The context mentions a specific syntax error in a GraphQL query, but it doesn't provide the actual query for us to examine directly. However, we can infer some information from the context that might help us understand the nature of the error. First, let's recall that n-gram matching is a method used to evaluate the similarity between strings by looking for contiguous sequences of words or phrases (n-grams) in both strings. In the context, it seems that the GraphQL query example contains a syntax error related to missing commas, which might affect the performance of n-gram matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Based on the information provided in the context, the syntax error in the GraphQL query example related to the evaluation of n-gram matches is likely to be missing commas between fields or arguments that are expected to be separated by commas. For instance, if a list of fields or arguments is expected but not properly enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas, n-gram matching might not work correctly due to the incorrect query structure. Example: Instead of `Get{ Product( field1 field2 ) }`, it should be `Get{ Product( field1, field2 ) }`.\n",

We think Ref2Vec can also help address this challenge. To be clear, Weaviate already offers a solution to represent long documents with Cross-References!

So, in the worst case, you could end up with 32 parallel imports (on a machine with \"only\" 8 CPUs).»\n",
