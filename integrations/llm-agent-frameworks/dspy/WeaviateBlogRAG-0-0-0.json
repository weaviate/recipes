The image below presents the scoring calculation of BM25:\n![BM25 calculation](./img/BM25-calculation.png) <div align=\"center\"><i>Source: Wikipedia page on Okapi BM25</i></div>\n\nThe score of the document, query pair is determined by weighing the uniqueness of each keyword in the query relative to the collection of texts.

        "source": "This case is quite similar to our discussion of Multi-Index Routing and we can similarly evaluate generations with a prompt that explains the needs for SQL and Vector Databases and then asks the LLM whether the router made the right decision. We can also use the RAGAS Context Relevance score for the results of the SQL query. <img\n  src={require('./img/sql-router.png').default}\n  alt=\"SQL Router Query Engine\"\n  style={{ maxWidth: \"60%\" }}\n/>\n\nConcluding our discussion of \u201cFrom RAG to Agent Evaluation\u201d, we believe that it is still too early to tell what the common patterns will be for agent use. We have intentionally shown the multi-hop query engine and query router because these are relatively straightforward to understand. Once we add more open-ended planning loops, tool use and the associated evaluation of how well the model can format API requests to the tool, and more meta internal memory management prompts such as the ideas in MemGPT, it is very difficult to provide a general abstraction around how Agents will be evaluated.",

        "source": "Typically this is in the context of recommendation in which we have metadata about users, as well as the documents or items. So for example, say we have features that describe a Users looking for Movies such as:\n\nUser Features - (Age, Gender, Location, Occupation, Preferences)\nMovie Features - (Release Year, Genre, Box Office, Duration). So together, the Metadata ranker takes as input something like: [Age, Gender, Location, Occupation, Preferences, Release year, Genre, Box Office, Duration] and predicts a score of how much this User will like the movie. We can fix the User features and rotate in each Document to get a score for each of the candidate movies (retrieved with something like ref2vec) to rank with. In addition to vectors, Weaviate also enables storing metadata features about objects such as `price`, or `color`.",

        "gold_answer": "The Metadata ranker predicts which movies a user will like by taking into account both user features (such as age, gender, location, occupation, and preferences) and movie features (such as release year, genre, box office, and duration). It fixes the user features and rotates in each movie to get a score for each of the candidate movies. This score is then used to rank the movies in order of predicted preference for the user, providing a personalized and context-aware recommendation."
