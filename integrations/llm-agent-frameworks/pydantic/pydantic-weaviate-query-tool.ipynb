    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "1. Weaviate Cloud instance (WCD): The Weaviate Query Agent is only accessible through WCD at the moment. You can create a serverless cluster or a free 14-day sandbox [here](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).\n",
    "1. Install Pydantic with `pip install pydantic`. We're using version `2.10.6` at the time of writing this notebook.\n",
    "1. Install the Weaviate Agents package with `pip install weaviate-agents`\n",
    "1. You'll need a Weaviate cluster with data. If you don't have one, check out [this notebook](integrations/Weaviate-Import-Example.ipynb) to import the Weaviate Blogs.\n"
