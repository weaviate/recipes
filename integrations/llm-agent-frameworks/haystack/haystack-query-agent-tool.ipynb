    "This notebook will show you how to define the Weaviate Query Agent as a tool through Haystack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "1. Weaviate Cloud instance (WCD): The Weaviate Query Agent is only accessible through WCD at the moment. You can create a serverless cluster or a free 14-day sandbox [here](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).\n",
    "1. Install Haystack with `pip install haystack-ai`\n",
    "1. Install the Weaviate Agents package with `pip install weaviate-agents`\n",
    "1. You'll need a Weaviate cluster with data. If you don't have one, check out [this notebook](integrations/Weaviate-Import-Example.ipynb) to import the Weaviate Blogs."
