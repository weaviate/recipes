      "The main intuition behind Product Quantization is that it adds the concept of segments to the compression function. Basically, to compress the full vector, we will chop it up and operate on segments of it. For example, if we have a 128 dimensional vector we could chop it up into 32 segments, meaning each segment would contain 4 dimensions. Following this segmentation step we compress each segment independently.author:None\n",

      "While async indexing helped with importing, [product quantization](/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-quantization#product-quantization) (PQ) was important for alleviating the memory footprint. PQ is a technique used to compress the size of vector embeddings by representing the vectors as centroid ids. The centroid ids are calculated by clustering each segment. We enabled PQ to reduce the memory requirements without slowing down the ingestion. You can either [manually](/developers/weaviate/configuration/pq-compression#manually-configure-pq) enable PQ or have it [automatically triggered](/developers/weaviate/configuration/pq-compression#configure-autopq) based on the number of vectors.author:None\n",
