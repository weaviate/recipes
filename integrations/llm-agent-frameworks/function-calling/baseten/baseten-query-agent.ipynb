    "### Requirements\n",
    "1. Weaviate Cloud instance (WCD): The Weaviate Query Agent is only accessible through WCD at the moment. You can create a serverless cluster or a free 14-day sandbox [here](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).\n",
    "1. Install the Weaviate Agents package with `pip install weaviate-agents`\n",
    "1. You'll need a Weaviate cluster with data. If you don't have one, check out [this notebook](integrations/Weaviate-Import-Example.ipynb) to import the Weaviate Blogs.\n"

      "\n",
      "1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure that you have both the `docker` and `docker-compose` CLI tools installed on your system. Installation processes may differ depending on your operating system, with specific installation guides available for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), and [Ubuntu Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Obtain the Docker Compose File**: You can either use a pre-prepared Docker Compose file or create a custom one using the [Weaviate configuration tool](https://www.weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose#configurator). The file should include all necessary configurations including any additional modules if required.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Run Docker Compose**: Navigate to the directory where your Docker Compose file, named `docker-compose.yml`, is stored. To start Weaviate, run the command:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker-compose up -d\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode, meaning they operate in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Check Readiness**: To confirm Weaviate is running, you can perform a readiness check by making an HTTP GET request to the endpoint `GET /v1/.well-known/ready` using a tool like `curl`. If the service is ready, it should return a 2xx HTTP status code.\n",
      "\n",
      "These steps should help you successfully run Weaviate in a Docker environment. If you plan to eventually move to a stable production environment, consider using Kubernetes alongside the official Weaviate Helm chart for better management and scalability.\n",
