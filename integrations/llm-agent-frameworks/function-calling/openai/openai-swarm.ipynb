It wouldn’t be hyperbole to say that NLP and Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm. Though this was not the first AI chatbot that has been released to the public, what really surprised people about this particular service was the breadth and depth of knowledge it had and its ability to articulate that knowledge with human-like responses. Aside from this, the generative aspect of this model is also quite apparent as it can hallucinate situations and dream up vivid details to fill in descriptions when prompted to do so. This gives the chatbot service somewhat of a human-like “creativity” - which is what adds a wow factor to the user experience!\\n\\nGenerative LLMs like ChatGPT\\'s GPT-3 (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) are trained on a huge corpora of open data from the internet - since the majority of general human knowledge is archived and accessible via the Internet, these models have a lot of training material to learn from.'"
