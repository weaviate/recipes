    "### Requirements\n",
    "1. Weaviate Cloud instance (WCD): The Weaviate Query Agent is only accessible through WCD at the moment. You can create a serverless cluster or a free 14-day sandbox [here](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).\n",
    "2. Together AI API key: You can grab an API key [here](https://api.together.xyz/).\n",
    "3. Install the Weaviate Agents package with `pip install weaviate-agents`\n",
    "4. You'll need a Weaviate cluster with data. If you don't have one, check out [this notebook](integrations/Weaviate-Import-Example.ipynb) to import the Weaviate Blogs.\n"

       "\"To run Weaviate with Docker, you should follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure that both Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. You can find the installation guides for different operating systems like Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu Linux in the Docker documentation ([Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), and [Docker for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)).\\n\\n2. **Obtain the Docker Compose File**: You can obtain a pre-configured `docker-compose.yml` file using the Weaviate configuration tool available on their website. Alternatively, you can use one of the example files from the Weaviate documentation.\\n\\n3. **Run the Docker Compose File**: Navigate to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located. Ensure it is named correctly as `docker-compose.yml`. Start the Weaviate setup by running the following command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   docker compose up -d\\n   ```\\n\\n   The `-d` option will run your containers in detached mode, meaning you won't see the logs in your terminal unless you specifically attach to them.\\n\\n4. **Verify Readiness**: To check if Weaviate is up and running, use the readiness check provided by Weaviate. You can programmatically check this by running a simple `bash` loop that checks on a specific endpoint:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   until curl --fail -s localhost:8080/v1/.well-known/ready; do\\n     sleep 1\\n   done\\n   ```\\n\\n   Adjust `localhost:8080` if you're running on a different bind address.\\n\\nThese steps will get Weaviate running on Docker for development and evaluation purposes. For a production environment, it is recommended to use a more robust setup like Kubernetes with Helm.\""
