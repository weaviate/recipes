    "1. Weaviate Cloud instance (WCD): The Weaviate Query Agent is only accessible through WCD at the moment. You can create a serverless cluster or a free 14-day sandbox [here](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).\n",
    "1. Install Cohere with `pip install cohere` and grab an API key [here](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)\n",
    "1. Install the Weaviate Agents package with `pip install weaviate-agents`\n",
    "1. You'll need a Weaviate cluster with data. If you don't have one, check out [this notebook](integrations/Weaviate-Import-Example.ipynb) to import the Weaviate Blogs."

Here are the steps to get started:\\n\\n1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**:\\n   - Make sure both the Docker and Docker Compose tools are installed on your system. The installation process can vary depending on your operating system. You can follow the official guides for [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), or [Docker for Ubuntu Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [Docker Compose for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\\n\\n2. **Obtain the Docker Compose File**:\\n   - The easiest method is to use the [Weaviate configuration tool](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose#configurator) available on the Weaviate website, which will customize a `docker-compose.yml` file based on your needs.\\n   - Another option is to copy one of the example files from the documentation.\\n\\n3. **Run Docker Compose**:\\n   - Ensure that you are in the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.\\n   - Use the following command to start Weaviate:\\n     ```bash\\n     docker compose up -d\\n     ```\\n   - The `-d` option will detach the terminal.\\n\\n4. **Check Status and Logs**:\\n   - To see the names and status of each container, use:\\n     ```bash\\n     docker compose ps\\n     ```\\n   - To view the logs of a specific container, replace `<container-name>` with the desired container:\\n     ```bash\\n     docker compose logs -f <container-name>\\n     ```\\n\\n5. **Verify Readiness**:\\n   - Weaviate provides a readiness check at `GET /v1/.well-known/ready`. You can use this to verify that the service is up and ready for requests by checking for a `2xx` HTTP status code.', sources=[Source(object_id='e38ecea0-2dde-49cb-820a-15e717af616b', collection='Blogs'), Source(object_id='ffb99316-b511-4316-8e1a-570ba72df28c', collection='Blogs'), Source(object_id='5bf37611-90e1-4dc1-91e1-f31fa9251f1e', collection='Blogs'), Source(object_id='1ae10b32-654f-48e6-8ce1-2455dbdb3c82', collection='Blogs'), Source(object_id='ec0d6c82-c927-4b9c-bc04-742dc3f9c7fe', collection='Blogs'), Source(object_id='9cbc08bf-c4bd-40b7-aa76-f5e1dcf8ac01', collection='Blogs')])"
