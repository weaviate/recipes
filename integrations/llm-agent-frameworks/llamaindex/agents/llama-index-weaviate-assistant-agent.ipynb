    "This recipe walks you through the difference between naive RAG, and an agent that has RAG tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example notebook, we are using 2 Weaviate collections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weaviate Docs:** This collection contains the technical documentation that you can find on weaviate.io. We've already created embeddings for them using `embed-multilingual-v3.0` by Cohere.\n",
    "2. **GitHub Issues:** A collection which contains some of the GitHub issues on Weaviate Verba.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To replicate the behaviour, you may choose to create and use 2 of your own Weavaite collections.**\n",
    "If you choose to do so, don't forget to change the RAG tools accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how providing these 2 collections and RAG over these collections as tools to an agent changes the way we are able to interact with them.\n",

This page describes some noteworthy metrics and their uses. Typically metrics are quite granular, as they can always be aggregated later on. For example if the granularity is \"shard\", you could aggregate all \"shard\" metrics of the same \"class\" to obtain a class metrics, or aggregate all metrics to obtain the metric for the entire Weaviate instance. | Metric | Description | Labels | Type | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | batch_durations_ms | Duration of a single batch operation in ms. The operation label further defines what operation as part of the batch (e.g. object, inverted, vector) is being used. Granularity is a shard of a class.  | operation, class_name, shard_name | Histogram | | batch_delete_durations_ms | Duration of a batch delete in ms. The operation label further defines what operation as part of the batch delete is being measured. Granularity is a shard of a class | class_name, shard_name | Histogram | | objects_durations_ms | Duration of an individual object operation, such as put, delete, etc. as indicated by the operation label, also as part of a batch. The step label adds additional precisions to each operation. Granularity is a shard of a class. | class_name, shard_name | Histogram | | object_count | Numbers of objects present. Granularity is a shard of a class | class_name, shard_name | Gauge | | async_operations_running | Number of currently running async operations. The operation itself is defined through the operation label. | operation, class_name, shard_name, path | Gauge | | lsm_active_segments | Number of currently present segments per shard. Granularity is shard of a class. Grouped by strategy.| strategy, class_name, shard_name, path | Gauge | | lsm_bloom_filter_duration_ms | Duration of a bloom filter operation per shard in ms. Granularity is shard of a class. Grouped by strategy. | operation, strategy, class_name, shard_name | Histogram | | lsm_segment_objects | Number of entries per LSM segment by level. Granularity is shard of a class. Grouped by strategy and level. | operation, strategy, class_name, shard_name, path, level | Gauge | | lsm_segment_size | Size of LSM segment by level and unit. | strategy, class_name, shard_name, path, level, unit | Gauge | | lsm_segment_count | Number of segments by level | strategy, class_name, shard_name, path, level | Gauge | | vector_index_tombstones | Number of currently active tombstones in the vector index.

The operation itself is defined by the operation label. | operation, class_name, shard_name | Gauge | | vector_index_size | The total capacity of the vector index. Typically larger than the number of vectors imported as it grows proactively. | class_name, shard_name | Gauge | | vector_index_maintenance_durations_ms | Duration of a sync or async vector index maintenance operation. The operation itself is defined through the operation label. | opeartion, class_name, shard_name | Histogram | | vector_index_durations_ms | Duration of regular vector index operation, such as insert or delete.

Vicuñas: Vicuñas are small, wild relatives of llamas and alpacas. They are found in the Andean region and are known for their soft, woolly coats. 2. Camels: Camels are large, even-toed ungulates that are closely related to llamas and vicuñas. They are found in hot, dry climates around the world and are known for their ability to go without water for long periods of time. 3. Guanacos: Guanacos are large, wild animals that are related to llamas and vicuñas. They are found in the Andean region and are known for their distinctive long necks and legs. 4. Llama-like creatures: There are also other animals that are sometimes referred to as \"llamas,\" such as the lama-like creatures found in China, which are actually a different species altogether. These creatures are not closely related to vicuñas or camels, but are sometimes referred to as \"llamas\" due to their physical similarities.

      "1. **Set Up a Locally Hosted Weaviate Instance**: Ensure that you have a locally hosted Weaviate instance, as the integration requires hosting your own Ollama models. You can find guidance on configuring Weaviate with Ollama models on the relevant integration page.\n",

      "2. **Configure Weaviate with the Ollama Generative AI Integration**: Your Weaviate instance must be configured with the `generative-ollama` module. This integration is not available for Weaviate Cloud (WCD) serverless instances, as it requires a locally running Ollama instance. For self-hosted users, check the cluster metadata to verify if the module is enabled and follow the guide to enable it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Access the Ollama Endpoint**: Ensure that your Weaviate instance can access the Ollama endpoint. If you are using Docker, specify the Ollama endpoint using the `host.docker.internal` alias to access the host machine from within the container.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Download and Install Ollama**: Download and install Ollama for your operating system. Once installed, the Ollama daemon will run in the background, allowing you to use the `ollama` command in the shell or Terminal to download and pull a language model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pull a Language Model**: Use the command `ollama pull llama3:latest` to download the Llama 3:8B model to your local machine. After downloading, you can run the model using `ollama run llama3:latest`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Use the Model for Inference**: Once the model is set up, you can perform inference through the API provided by Ollama, similar to how you would with OpenAI.\n",
