    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "1. Weaviate Cloud instance (WCD): The Weaviate Query Agent is only accessible through WCD at the moment. You can create a serverless cluster or a free 14-day sandbox [here](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).\n",
    "2. Install LlamaIndex with `pip install llama-index` (we used version `0.12.22` for this notebook)\n",
    "3. Install the Weaviate Agents package with `pip install weaviate-agents`\n",
    "4. You'll need a Weaviate cluster with data. If you don't have one, check out [this notebook](integrations/Weaviate-Import-Example.ipynb) to import the Weaviate Blogs.\n",

      "To run Weaviate with Docker, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure that you have Docker (version 17.09.0 or higher) and Docker Compose installed. You can find installation guides for various operating systems on the Docker documentation site.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Download a Weaviate Docker Image**: Use the command to pull the latest version of Weaviate:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker pull cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:latest\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Run Weaviate**: Start a Weaviate instance using the following command:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50051:50051 cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:latest\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This command will map the ports and start the Weaviate instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Using Docker Compose**: For a more manageable configuration, it's recommended to use Docker Compose. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the required setup. Here’s a simple example:\n",
      "   ```yaml\n",
      "   version: '3.8'\n",
      "   services:\n",
      "     weaviate:\n",
      "       image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:latest\n",
      "       ports:\n",
      "         - \"8080:8080\"\n",
      "         - \"50051:50051\"\n",
      "       environment:\n",
      "         AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: \"true\"\n",
      "         PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: \"/var/lib/weaviate\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   Place this file in a directory and run:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker-compose up -d\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Check the Status**: After starting, you can check if Weaviate is running by sending a request to its readiness endpoint:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl --fail -s localhost:8080/v1/.well-known/ready\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This command will confirm if Weaviate is up and ready for use.\n"
