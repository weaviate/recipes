            "**Part 1: Prepare the Mashed Potato Topping**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Boil Potatoes:** Place the peeled and chopped potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water by about an inch. Add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and simmer until the potatoes are very tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes.\n",
            "2.  **Mash Potatoes:** Drain the potatoes thoroughly. Return them to the hot pot over low heat for a minute or two to dry them out slightly (this helps prevent watery mash). Remove from heat.\n",
            "3.  Add the milk, butter, garlic powder (if using), salt, and pepper to the potatoes. Mash with a potato masher until smooth and creamy. Stir in Parmesan or nutritional yeast if desired. Taste and adjust seasoning. Set aside.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Part 2: Prepare the Savory Lentil & Mushroom Filling**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or deep oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5-7 minutes.\n",
            "2.  **Add Mushrooms & Garlic:** Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their liquid and start to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n",
            "3.  **Build Flavor Base:** Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to deepen its flavor.\n",
            "4.  **Add Lentils & Liquids:** Add the rinsed lentils, vegetable broth, diced tomatoes (undrained), soy sauce/tamari, dried thyme, dried rosemary, and bay leaf. Stir well to combine.\n",
            "5.  **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30-35 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\n",
            "6.  **Thicken Filling:** Remove the bay leaf. In a small bowl, whisk the flour with 2 tablespoons of cold water until smooth (if using cornstarch, use 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water). Stir this slurry into the lentil mixture. Cook, stirring, for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.\n",
            "7.  **Add Frozen Veggies:** Stir in the frozen peas and corn. Cook for 2-3 minutes until heated through.\n",
            "8.  **Season:** Taste the filling and adjust salt and pepper as needed. It should be rich and savory.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Part 3: Assemble and Bake the Shepherd's Pie**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n",
            "2.  **Assemble:** Pour the hot lentil and mushroom filling into a 9x13 inch baking dish (or an equivalent oven-safe dish).\n",
            "3.  **Top with Potatoes:** Carefully spoon the mashed potato topping over the filling, spreading it evenly to cover the entire surface. You can use a fork to create decorative ridges on top, which will crisp up nicely.\n",
            "4.  **Bake:** Place the baking dish on a baking sheet (to catch any potential drips). Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbly around the edges and the mashed potato topping is golden brown. If you want a darker crust, you can briefly broil it for the last 2-3 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning.\n",
            "5.  **Rest and Serve:** Let the shepherd's pie rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This allows the filling to set slightly. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley if desired.\n",
            "\n",
            "Enjoy your delicious and comforting Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie, Sam! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n"

Instead of meat, you can make a rich, savory filling with lentils, mushrooms, carrots, peas, and corn in a flavorful gravy (think vegetable broth, tomato paste, herbs like thyme and rosemary). Top it all with a generous layer of fluffy, buttery mashed potatoes, and bake until golden and bubbly. It's incredibly satisfying and a great way to get lots of veggies in.\n",

            "    *   **Hearty:** Steamed broccoli florets, sautéed mushrooms and onions, black beans, or even a scoop of vegetarian chili.\n",
            "    *   **Mexican-inspired:** Salsa, guacamole, a dollop of plain yogurt, and some crumbled cotija cheese (or feta).\n",

            "3.  **Hearty Potato and Chickpea Curry:**\n",
            "    If you're in the mood for something with a bit more spice and warmth, a potato and chickpea curry is fantastic. You can simmer diced potatoes and chickpeas in a rich coconut milk-based sauce with onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, and your favorite curry spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala).
