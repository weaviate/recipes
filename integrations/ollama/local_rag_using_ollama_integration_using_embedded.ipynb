These vectors are typically dense numerical arrays used to represent objects, such as images, documents, or audio files.\\n\\nVector databases are designed to efficiently store and retrieve large numbers of vectors, often with millions or billions of dimensions (features). They provide fast query capabilities, such as:\\n\\n1. **Nearest Neighbor Search**: Find the most similar vector(s) to a given query vector.\\n2. **Similarity Search**: Retrieve all vectors that have a similarity score above a certain threshold.\\n3. **Range Search**: Return all vectors within a certain distance or range from a query vector.\\n\\nVector databases are commonly used in various applications, such as:\\n\\n1. **Computer Vision**: Object recognition, image search, and facial recognition.\\n2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.\\n3. **Audio Analysis**: Music recommendation, speech recognition, and audio indexing.\\n\\nSome popular vector database technologies include:\\n\\n1. **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search): A library for efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.\\n2. **Annoy** (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah!): A C++ library for efficient nearest neighbor search.\\n3. **Hnswlib** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Library): A Python library for efficient nearest neighbor search.\\n\\nVector databases are particularly useful when dealing with large-scale data and complex queries that involve similarity searches or clustering. They can provide significant performance improvements compared to traditional database systems, which are often optimized for structured data and simple query patterns.\\n\\nIf you're interested in learning more about vector databases, I'd be happy to provide more information on the underlying algorithms and techniques used in these technologies!\",\"done\":true,\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"context\":[128006,882,128007,271,3923,374,264,4724,4729,30,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,32,4724,4729,11,1101,3967,439,264,4724,3637,477,4724,1963,11,374,264,955,315,4729,430,46672,304,28672,323,82198,1579,33520,23728,13,4314,23728,527,11383,29050,35876,18893,1511,311,4097,6302,11,1778,439,5448,11,9477,11,477,7855,3626,382,3866,32906,527,6319,311,30820,3637,323,17622,3544,5219,315,23728,11,3629,449,11990,477,33151,315,15696,320,20922,570,2435,3493,5043,3319,17357,11,1778,439,1473,16,13,3146,8989,15795,98263,7694,96618,7531,279,1455,4528,4724,1161,8,311,264,2728,3319,4724,627,17,13,3146,35502,488,7694,96618,32662,682,23728,430,617,264,38723,5573,3485,264,3738,12447,627,18,13,3146,6174,7694,96618,3494,682,23728,2949,264,3738,6138,477,2134,505,264,3319,4724,382,3866,32906,527,17037,1511,304,5370,8522,11,1778,439,1473,16,13,3146,38432,31541,96618,3075,18324,11,2217,2778,11,323,28900,18324,627,17,13,3146,55381,11688,29225,320,45,12852,33395,25,2991,24790,11,27065,6492,11,323,2038,57470,627,18,13,3146,15097,18825,96618,10948,28782,11,8982,18324,11,323,7855,53080,382,8538,5526,4724,4729,14645,2997,1473,16,13,3146,3711,31949,334,320,21124,15592,22196,488,7694,1680,362,6875,369,11297,38723,2778,304,1579,33520,12908,627,17,13,3146,2127,2201,88,334,320,70620,3509,4275,15795,4275,25068,8840,22335,0,1680,362,356,1044,6875,369,11297,24379,9760,2778,627,18,13,3146,39,77,2332,2808,334,320,76009,46334,452,3030,481,15344,4435,11896,1680,362,13325,6875,369,11297,24379,9760,2778,382,3866,32906,527,8104,5505,994,14892,449,3544,13230,828,323,6485,20126,430,21736,38723,27573,477,59454,13,2435,649,3493,5199,5178,18637,7863,311,8776,4729,6067,11,902,527,3629,34440,369,34030,828,323,4382,3319,12912,382,2746,499,2351,8173,304,6975,810,922,4724,32906,11,358,4265,387,6380,311,3493,810,2038,389,279,16940,26249,323,12823,1511,304,1521,14645,0,128009],\"total_duration\":13055860500,\"load_duration\":1407006458,\"prompt_eval_count\":15,\"prompt_eval_duration\":209480000,\"eval_count\":372,\"eval_duration\":11437718000}"
