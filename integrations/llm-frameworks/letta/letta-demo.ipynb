The main idea is that during the indexing stage, it builds a graph with a small-world property that allows for quick traversal. The graph's vertices are the data items, and each vertex has a set of connections on different layers - the lowest layer connects to the nearest items, while the higher layers have connections that span larger distances. This hierarchy significantly accelerates the search process because it can quickly navigate to the right area in earlier, higher layers, then fine-tune on lower layers. Would you like a more technical deep dive, perhaps focusing on the insertion algorithm or the search algorithm?\"\n",

It works by dividing the high-dimensional vector space into smaller, manageable subspaces. Then, it independently quantizes each subspace into 'codewords' derived from a limited 'codebook'. When a vector is stored, it's mapped to a combination of these codewords from the different subspaces. The high-dimensional vector retrieval now becomes retrieving the local codewords and assembling them. Thus, instead of storing the high-dimensional vector in full, we store the compact indices referencing the codebook. This reduces the storage requisite dramatically without gravely compromising the search precision. Essentially, PQ trades a bit of accuracy for the benefit of significant memory efficiency.\"\n",

The main goal of this new feature is to offer similar performance at a fraction of the memory requirements and cost. In this blog we expand on the details behind this delicate balance between recall performance and memory management. In our previous blog [Vamana vs. HNSW - Exploring ANN algorithms Part 1](/blog/ann-algorithms-vamana-vs-hnsw), we explained the challenges and benefits of the Vamana and HNSW indexing algorithms.'}\n",
      "[Search Result 3] {'content': 'This feature allows HNSW to work directly with compressed vectors. This means using Product Quantization to compress vectors and calculate distances. As mentioned before, we could still store the complete representation of the vectors on disk and use them to correct the distances as we explore nodes during querying. For the time being, we are implementing only HNSW+PQ which means we do no correction to the distances. In the future we will explore adding such a correction and see the implications in recall and latency since we will have more accurate distances but also much more disk reads.'}\n",

However, vector libraries only store vector embeddings of data objects, and they store them in in-memory indexes. This results in two key differences:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.'}\\\\n[Search Result 3] {'content': '### Indexing Knobs\\\\\\\\nFor the sake of designing RAG systems, the most important indexing knob looks like vector compression settings. Launched in March 2023, Weaviate 1.18 introduced Product Quantization (PQ). PQ is a vector compression algorithm that groups contiguous segments of a vector, clusters their values across the collection, and then reduces the precision with centroids. For example, a contiguous segment of 4 32-bit floats requires 16 bytes to represent, a segment length of 4 with 8 centroids results in only needing 1 byte, a 16:1 memory reduction. Recent advances in PQ Rescoring help significantly with recall loss from this compression, but is still an important consideration with very high levels of compression.'}\\\\n[Search Result 4] {'content': \\\\\\\"Weaviate was built to combine the speed and capabilities of ANN algorithms with the features of a database such as backups, real-time queries, persistence, and replication (part of the v1.17 release). Weaviate can be accessed through GraphQL, REST, and client libraries in multiple programming languages. ### Example Use Cases\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVector databases are great to use for your application if your data is constantly changing. You can use vector search engines for e-commerce recommendations, image search, semantic similarity, and the list goes on.

It is a robust and fast algorithm that builds a hierarchical representation of the index **in memory** that could be quickly traversed to find the k nearest neighbors of a query vector. ## Need for disk solutions\\\\\\\\nThere are other challenges to overcome.

In contrast, with the Tile encoder it would be nearly three minutes. Additionally, notice that when Product Quantization is used with HNSW, we will need to compress at some point. This will mean fitting the existing data and encoding existing vectors. It will also need to compress the rest of the incoming vectors as they come.'}\\\",\\n  \\\"time\\\": \\\"2024-10-27 10:14:08 PM EDT-0400\\\"\\n}\",\n",

Here's an overview of how it works:\\\\n\\\\n- PQ introduces the idea of segments in the compression algorithm. To compress a vector, it gets divided into smaller parts, or segments, which are compressed separately.\\\\n\\\\n- To illustrate, if we're dealing with a 128-dimensional vector, this could be divided into 32 segments, with each segment containing 4 dimensions. Each of these segments is then compressed independently.\\\\n\\\\n- An analogy to understand how PQ works is to consider vectors as unique house addresses. These addresses allow for precision in locating a house, right down to the house number. PQ 'compresses' this, akin to representing the full address information with just a zip code, which reduces precision but leads to substantial memory savings.\\\\n\\\\nWhile PQ is highly efficient for reducing memory requirements, it's worth noting that it typically comes with a slight loss of recall, which can sometimes be counteracted with techniques like rescoring.\\\"\\n}\",\n",
