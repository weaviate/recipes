    "# Query Agent Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this recipe, we extend the E-Commerce Query Agent and show how to evaluate and improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [TruLens](https://www.trulens.org/) to trace and evaluate the agent. By using TruLens we can identify opportunities to improve the agent, track our experiments, and compare across versions of the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the agent, we can access metadata from the intermediate steps in the trace. Then, we can use this metadata to evaluate things like the relevance of the filter used by the query agent, or the relevance of the intermediate search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Custom evaluations](https://www.trulens.org/component_guides/evaluation/feedback_implementations/custom_feedback_functions/) are particularly valuable here, because they allow us to easily extend existing feedbacks to unique scenarios. In this example, we show how to record a Query Agent run. We also show how to use custom instructions to customize an existing LLM judge to provide tailored feedback for our situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating this ecommerce agent, we are able to identify opportunities for improvement when the search results include items that do not match what the customer is looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow along!"
