    "# Deploy Trustworthy RAG with Weaviate and Cleanlab\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally hallucinate incorrect answers, especially for questions not well-supported within their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by supplying LLMs with context retrieved from knowledge databases like Weaviate. While organizations are rapidly adopting RAG to pair the power of LLMs with their own proprietary data, hallucinated/incorrect RAG responses remain a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates an easy solution: build *trustworthy* RAG applications using Weaviate and Cleanlab to mitigate hallucinated/incorrect responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleanlab boosts the reliability of any LLM application by scoring when LLM responses are untrusworthy. Trust scoring happens in real-time and does not require any data labeling or model training work. Cleanlab provides additional real-time Evals for other RAG components like the retrieved context, which help you diagnose *why* certain RAG responses and inaccurate/bad. Cleanlab's detection enables you to automatically flag/prevent inaccurate/bad responses from your RAG app, and avoid losing your users' trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate streamlines RAG application development, providing a scalable vector database to store your organization's knowledge, as well vectorizers and integrations with generative model providers (like OpenAI & Anthropic). By providing all of the necessary components via a simple developer experience, Weaviate enables you to quickly deploy a performant RAG application. Adding Cleanlab on top provides an additional layer of trust."
