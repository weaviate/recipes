    "# Patronus `Lynx` Hallucination Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In AI systems, the term **Hallucination** is used to describe cases where an AI model produces responses that are broadly defined as not factual. For example, if you ask an LLM, `What is the atomic number of oxygen?` and it returns `15`, that would be considered a **Hallucination**, as the correct atomic number of oxygen is `8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hallucinations** are of course worrisome for all cases of AI systems, but they are especially important for systems that utilize Retreival-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is generally predicated upon the promise of equipping LLMs with knowledge about your particular context, and it is thus especially important to make sure this is indeed being achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent [paper from researchers at Yale University](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17004) highlights that completely avoiding **Hallucinations** in LLMs is extremely difficult, if not impossible. It is very unlikely that the next generation of LLMs will magically solve this problem with increased compute, new neural network architectures, or more training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we have several techniques to combat **Hallucinations** that are getting stronger and stronger, especially in the context of RAG. In this notebook, we will firstly present the `Lynx` model from Patronus AI. As explained further in their [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08488), `Lynx` is a state-of-the-art model for **Hallucination** detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Weaviate side of the house, we have kicked off our efforts to fight **Hallucinations** with the Weaviate Query Agent by instructing the model to cite its sources with a structured output model and return a `sources` output to the user in the final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will illustrate how to evaluate if the Weaviate Query Agent is **hallucinating** by connecting the returned `sources` with `Lynx` and Patronus AI's observability platform!\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook is using patronus `0.1.3`\n",

    "This Python code uses the Patronus library to evaluate AI responses for hallucinations. It sets up a hallucination detector that checks if an AI's answer about `the largest animal in the world` (claiming it's \"the giant sandworm\") aligns with the provided factual context stating **blue whales** hold this title, rather than the fictional sandworms from Dune. The code demonstrates automated detection of when AI systems provide fictional information instead of factual answers."

      "\n",
      "## On the HNSW vs. Vamana comparison\n",
      "As the first step to disk-based vector indexing, we decided to explore Vamana – the algorithm behind the DiskANN solution. Here are some key differences between Vamana and HNSW:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Vamana indexing - in short:\n",
      "* Build a random graph.\n",
      "* Optimize the graph, so it only connects vectors close to each other.\n",
      "* Modify the graph by removing some short connections and adding some long-range edges to speed up the traversal of the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "### HNSW indexing - in short:\n",
      "* Build a hierarchy of layers to speed up the traversal of the nearest neighbor graph.\n",
      "* In this graph, the top layers contain only long-range edges.\n",
      "* The deeper the search traverses through the hierarchy, the shorter the distance between vectors captured in the edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put simply, Vamana can build a flat graph, in contrast to HNSW, which uses a hierarchical representation. And a flat graph may suffer less performance degradation from being stored on disk than a hierarchical representation might. The reason is that since the outgoing connections from each node are known, it is possible to store the information in such a way that we can calculate the exact position on the\n",
      "\n",
      "Search Result #3\n",
      "\n",
      "NSW works by organizing vectors into a hierarchical, multi-layered graph structure, which allows for fast navigation through the dataset during search. The structure of HNSW balances longer distances for faster search in upper layers and shorter distances for accurate search in lower layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Weaviate's implementation, HNSW is enhanced to support full [CRUD operations](https://weaviate.io/blog/crud-support-in-weaviate) and allows for real-time querying, updates, and deletions, with features like incremental disk writes for crash recovery and [asynchronous cleanup processes](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib/issues/4#issuecomment-678315156) for maintaining index freshness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check out [Weaviate ANN benchmarks](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/benchmarks/ann) to see how HNSW performed on realistic large-scale datasets. You can use it to compare the tradeoffs between recall, QPS, latency, and import time.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will find it interesting to see that Weaviate can maintain very high recall rates (\\>95%), whilst keeping high throughput and low latency (both in milliseconds). That is exactly what you need for fast, but reliable vector search\\!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re interested in benchmarking for your own dataset, [check out this webinar](https://events.weaviate.io/benchmarking-webinar).\n",

      " other (e.g., in clusters or a graph), so that you can later find similar objects faster. This process is called vector indexing. Note that the speed gains are traded in for some accuracy because the ANN approach returns only the approximate results.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the previous example, one option would be to pre-calculate some clusters, e.g., animals, fruits, and so on. So, when you query the database for \"Kitten\", you could start your search by only looking at the closest animals and not waste time calculating the distances between all fruits and other non-animal objects. More specifically, the ANN algorithm can help you to start the search in a region near, e.g., four-legged animals. Then, the algorithm would also prevent you from venturing further from relevant results.\n",

      "Quantization is a technique used to compress data, particularly vectors, by reducing the amount of information stored per dimension.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of vectors (commonly used in machine learning and search applications), quantization works by encoding each dimension of a float vector with fewer bits. A common and powerful form is Binary Quantization (BQ), where each dimension is represented by a single bit: 1 if the value is positive and 0 if it is negative. This drastically reduces memory usage—as much as 32x compared to storing each dimension as a 32-bit float—and accelerates computations, as operations on binary vectors (using bitwise operations like XOR) are extremely fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how the process essentially works: imagine each vector is like a home address, with each number describing how to reach a location in space. Normally, these details are very precise, but take up a lot of space. Quantization keeps only the sign (direction) for each dimension; with binary quantization, it’s as simple as “go positive or negative along each axis.” While this approach loses information about the magnitude (how far to go), it retains overall direction, which, especially for high-dimensional data, is often enough to distinguish between items with minimal overlap/collision.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a 384-dimensional float vector becomes a 384-bit binary code after quantization. While this makes the representation much smaller and faster to compare, it also means different vectors that only vary in magnitude (not sign) become indistinguishable, so there is a trade-off between accuracy (recall) and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other quantization techniques, like Product Quantization (PQ), split the vector into sections (segments) and compress each one using clustering methods like KMeans, further reducing memory while preserving accuracy better than just retaining the sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantization is most effective when the data is well distributed (often normalized). Otherwise, many vectors may collapse into the same binary code, making them indistinguishable.\n",

      "Matryoshka embeddings, also known as embeddings trained with Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), are a type of vector embedding designed to offer flexible trade-offs between accuracy, storage size, and computational efficiency. Unlike traditional embeddings where all dimensions are equally important, Matryoshka embeddings are structured so that the information is concentrated in the earlier dimensions of the vector. Subsequent dimensions add finer details, much like adding higher resolutions to an image.\n",

This enables you to store more embeddings at lower precision or cost and to search faster, with minimal loss in accuracy.\n",

As a result, a single trained model produces vectors where the first N dimensions contain as much meaningful information as possible for any choice of N up to the model's maximum length. For example, OpenAI's 'text-embedding-3-small' and 'text-embedding-3-large' models use this approach, allowing their output size to be configurable at inference time, so the user can select the dimensionality that best fits their application.\n",
