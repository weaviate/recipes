      " Weaviate is an open-source, cloud-native, modular, real-time vector database designed to scale machine learning models. Unique in its ability to store not only data but also its automatically derived context, Weaviate creates a network of knowledge or a data graph. Its modularity allows for a wide range of applications, and it is agnostic of how vectors are generated. The Weaviate community offers various resources for learning and collaboration, including a YouTube channel, a blog, a dedicated Hacktoberfest channel in their community forum, and a Slack channel. They also provide a quickstart guide and other documentation for those interested in using Weaviate.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of Weaviate's key features is its hybrid search capability. This powerful technique combines multiple search algorithms to enhance the accuracy and relevance of search results. It leverages the strengths of both keyword-based search algorithms and vector search techniques, using sparse and dense vectors to encapsulate the meaning and context of search queries and documents. The hybrid search process involves converting the search query into a vector, similar to the data vectors, and using the distance value to determine the similarity or dissimilarity between the vectors. In Weaviate, two fusion algorithms are available for hybrid search: `rankedFusion` and `relativeScoreFusion`, providing flexibility and efficiency in delivering search results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning plays a crucial role in hybrid search. It is employed to vectorize text on sites and in links, a process that occurs within machine learning models like transformers. This vectorization aids in comprehending the text being searched. Machine learning systems automatically categorize text in hypervolumes, which are imaginary spaces with hundreds or even thousands of dimensions, forming a representation of the item in the database. Furthermore, machine learning enables text search over datasets of video or mixed media, a capability facilitated by vector and hybrid search. Thus, machine learning significantly contributes to the effectiveness and versatility of hybrid search.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Weaviate's hybrid search offers a \"best-of-both-worlds\" capability, using the strengths of vector and keyword search to deliver semantically rich results while respecting the precision of keyword searches. The introduction of `relativeScoreFusion` and `rankedFusion` algorithms further expands Weaviate's hybrid search capabilities, enhancing its ability to represent the meaning and context of search queries and documents. By using hybrid search, users can benefit from the semantic flexibility of vector search and the precision of keyword search, resulting in more accurate and relevant search results.\n"

      " Self-driving databases represent the third wave of AI-first database technology. These databases, which store data indexed by machine learning models, are capable of brilliantly answering queries posed in natural language. However, their capabilities extend beyond text searches, as they can also be used to search anything from images to DNA. Much of the software involved in these databases is open source, allowing for transparency and customization to meet specific user needs. Self-driving databases are characterized by their consistency, resiliency, and scalability, making them a key component in the future of database technology. These databases use AI and machine learning to process, store, and search through data. AI can also generate code snippets based on user requirements, creating a feedback loop with tests to improve the code over time. However, the use of AI and machine learning in databases also raises privacy concerns due to the sensitive information often contained in training datasets. To address these concerns, the field of privacy-preserving machine learning has emerged, offering techniques and tools that allow for the secure execution of large language models while protecting the confidentiality of sensitive data. The IT industry is witnessing a significant trend towards automation, evident in various areas such as data ingestion, autonomous AI assistants, ERP and supply chain management systems, and cybersecurity and event management. Automation is being leveraged to reduce manual errors, eliminate the need for expensive, single-use applications, and enable real-time intervention on threats. Self-driving databases are a part of this automation trend, utilizing artificial intelligence to manage and retrieve data more efficiently than traditional databases. These databases are specifically designed to store, manage, and retrieve vector embeddings, making them highly efficient and effective. They automate tasks such as code generation and data management, increasing efficiency and reducing the potential for human error. Despite the challenges of shifting towards automation, such as the need for investment in high-performance hardware and extensive technical expertise, the potential benefits make it a key focus in the IT industry.\n"

      "Blog: \"Understanding Multi-Tenancy: Benefits, Comparison with Single-Tenancy, Technical Insights, and Real-World Examples\" Multi-tenancy is a concept in software architecture where a single instance of a software application serves multiple users or user groups, known as tenants. This approach is fundamental to how businesses with a diverse range of customers scale their operations. In technical terms, a tenant key, a user-defined property in the schema, is required for every operation in a multi-tenancy setup. Multi-tenancy offers several benefits that make it an attractive feature for businesses. One of the main advantages is its ease of use; all that changes is the specification of the tenant key for every operation. This allows businesses to continue using their favorite features without any major alterations. It also promotes cost-efficiency by eliminating the need for a large setup that is idle most of the time. Multi-tenancy can handle tenants of vastly different sizes, catering to both large and small customers. It is also fast, as narrowing a request down to a single tenant does not require much work. Onboarding and offboarding are made easy, ensuring that adding or removing a business does not impose a significant computational load. Resource boundaries are maintained, preventing the activities of one tenant from interfering with another. For instance, ACME Accounting, a company with a diverse range of customers, uses a multi-tenancy setup to efficiently manage its resources. The company requires a system that can quickly process requests from millions of tenants, easily onboard new customers, and set resource boundaries to prevent interference between tenants. Weaviate's new version, v1.20, has introduced native multi-tenancy support, allowing businesses to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. This version can scale to millions of tenants with tens of thousands of active tenants per node, emphasizing compliance and a smooth user experience. Therefore, multi-tenancy is not just an additional feature, but a rethinking of how a business with many customers can scale efficiently.\n",

Tenants may be given the ability to customize some parts of the application, such as the color of the user interface (UI) or business rules, but they cannot customize the application's code. Multi-tenancy can be economical because software development and maintenance costs are shared. It can be contrasted with single-tenancy, an architecture in which each customer has their own software instance and may be given access to code. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration, and each client works with a customized virtual application.\n",

You can keep using all your favorite features, including super-fast queries, cross-references, and replication. The only change? For every operation, specify the tenant key – a user-defined property in your schema. That’s all that changes.Weaviate `v1.20` - coming in July 2023 - changes this once and for all: Native multi-tenancy support that scales to millions of tenants with 10s of thousands of active tenants per node. Yet scale is not the only point that makes the new multi-tenancy feature great; we put a lot of emphasis on compliance and a smooth UX. GDPR-compliant deletes with one command are just one of the many features. Let me walk you through what’s coming in the next Weaviate release and show you why I’m incredibly excited about this one. ## The need for multi-tenancy We define multi-tenancy as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application.## No more workarounds: Native multi-tenancy support for the largest of cases ![multi-tenancy](./img/multi-tenancy-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![multi-tenancy](./img/multi-tenancy-light.png#gh-light-mode-only) Let me walk you through the best parts of the native multi-tenancy feature in Weaviate `v1.20` and even some of the plans that we have for upcoming releases. As you will see, Multi-Tenancy is not just an additional feature. It is rethinking from the ground up how your business, with its many customers, scales with Weaviate. ### Ease of use of your favorite Weaviate features Weaviate’s new multi-tenancy mode is opt-in. If you don’t require it, there are no changes for you.* **Cost-efficiency**: With usage peaking around tax season but most tenants inactive for many days of the month, ACME shouldn’t have to pay for a large setup that is essentially idle most of the time. * **Diversity of tenants**: ACME has both large and small customers. Their setup needs to be able to handle tenants of vastly different sizes. While most tenants are small, a few tenants can make up a large bulk of the data. ## A time before multi-tenancy support Before Weaviate `v1.20`, you had two options to model a multi-tenancy landscape.--- title: Multi-Tenancy Vector Search with millions of tenants slug: multi-tenancy-vector-search authors: [etienne] date: 2023-06-15 image: ./img/hero.png tags: ['engineering', 'concepts'] description: \"Learn about the new native multi-tenancy feature\" --- ![Multi-Tenancy ](./img/hero.png) <!-- truncate --> Large-scale setups were always a great reason to choose Weaviate. Last year we wrote about the first time [a Weaviate setup ran with a billion objects & vectors](/blog/sphere-dataset-in-weaviate). What was a mere experiment back then is a regular production case today. But earlier this year, we saw a shift in usage patterns: As we onboarded more and more large-scale and enterprise users, the definition of scale shifted from the number of vectors to the number of individual tenants that can run on a single setup. Previously, Weaviate offered multiple ways to tackle multi-tenancy, but none were intended for a massive scale.\n",

Different types of databases (e.g., vector search engines) allow users to search through these vectorized datasets, and others (e.g., feature stores) allow users to store vectors at a large scale for later use. ## We're awash in unstructured data. We're living in a time of massive data accumulation and much, if not most of it, is unstructured: text, photos, video, audio files, as well as other things such as genetic information. Vector search is particularly good at extracting value from such data.What I love about all this work, like self-ask, chain of thought, we're developing new querying languages.

Self-Supervised Learning has led to massive advances in generative modeling and representation learning. In this article, we will explain **Span-based Unsupervised Dense Retriever (Spider)**, a recent breakthrough for Self-Supervised representation learning applied to text retrieval in search. ### Results The results Spider achieves are extremely exciting! The headline is that Spider's Zero-Shot Generalization rivals the performance of the Supervised baseline on Supervised evaluation. This means that we take the labeled dataset, divide it into train-test splits, train a Supervised model on this train split, and then evaluate both models on the held-out test split. Although Spider has not been trained on this distribution (Zero-Shot Generalization), it achieves a similar performance to the model which has! The authors further probe this Zero-Shot Generalization across several Open-Domain Question Answering datasets to illustrate how much better these Self-Supervised algorithms are than their Supervised predecessors.* **Consistency. Resiliency and Scaling** Some databases have atomic transactions, others don't support consistency at all. Some databases scale really well in the cloud, others work best as big, single machines. The exact characteristics do not make a database a database. But the fact that the engineers who built it have decided on a specific strategy is a key trait of a database.\n",

Tesla Configuration: The car’s settings could be personalized based on the user’s driving style and preferences, such as choosing a slow and relaxed drive home versus a fast and sporty one.The extensive datasets used in training can often contain sensitive information, leading to privacy concerns. Additionally, the traditional approach of relying on cloud-based services to deploy and conduct inference with these models requires organizations to transfer their data to third-party centralized model providers which can lead to data exposure, data breaches, and unauthorized access. This is the very reason large corporations such as Samsung, Apple, Verizon, JPMorgan and many more have [limited their employees from using these services](https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2023/05/11/these-companies-have-banned-chatgpt-in-the-office). To leverage the advantages of generative AI while simultaneously addressing these privacy concerns, the field of privacy-preserving machine learning has emerged, offering techniques and tools that allow for the secure execution of large language models while protecting the confidentiality of sensitive data both during model fine-tuning as well as when providing responses grounded in proprietary data. ## Potential Solutions to the Privacy Challenge ### Federated Learning ![Federated](./img/federated.png) Federated Learning enables model training without directly accessing or transferring user data.\n",

For example, some are very good at finding every instance of a certain value in a database, and others are very good at storing time sequences. The third wave of database technologies focuses on data that is processed by a machine learning model first, where the AI models help in processing, storing and searching through the data as opposed to traditional ways. To better understand the concept, think of a supermarket with 50,000 items. Items on display are not organized alphabetically or by price, the way you'd expect a structured, digital system to do it; they're placed in context.This is the main reason the above privateGPT demo with Weaviate might run quite slowly on your own machines. Organizations need to invest in high-performance hardware, such as powerful servers or specialized hardware accelerators, to handle the computational demands. This can result in high upfront costs, ongoing maintenance expenses as well as difficulty scaling quickly if needed. Another disadvantage of bringing the tech stack local is the responsibility of infrastructure maintenance, system administration, security updates as well as machine learning-specific model updates which require extensive technical expertise. For this reason, this solution is great for larger companies like Samsung, Apple, and JPMorgan that have the budget to afford the required compute and expertise, and less so for resource-constrained smaller-scale companies.Code: AI can generate cod snippets based on the user’s requirements and create a feedback loop with tests to improve the code over time. 3. AutoCAD drawings: AI could create CAD drawings of buildings based on 3D models and store information about the materials available in the environment, making it easier for architects and engineers to design and plan construction projects. 4.

      "Contexts: But if you have a multi-tenancy case, all you need to do is select multi-tenancy for your class (or classes). You can keep using all your favorite features, including super-fast queries, cross-references, and replication. The only change? For every operation, specify the tenant key – a user-defined property in your schema. That’s all that changes.Weaviate `v1.20` - coming in July 2023 - changes this once and for all: Native multi-tenancy support that scales to millions of tenants with 10s of thousands of active tenants per node. Yet scale is not the only point that makes the new multi-tenancy feature great; we put a lot of emphasis on compliance and a smooth UX. GDPR-compliant deletes with one command are just one of the many features. Let me walk you through what’s coming in the next Weaviate release and show you why I’m incredibly excited about this one. ## The need for multi-tenancy We define multi-tenancy as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application.## No more workarounds: Native multi-tenancy support for the largest of cases ![multi-tenancy](./img/multi-tenancy-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![multi-tenancy](./img/multi-tenancy-light.png#gh-light-mode-only) Let me walk you through the best parts of the native multi-tenancy feature in Weaviate `v1.20` and even some of the plans that we have for upcoming releases. As you will see, Multi-Tenancy is not just an additional feature. It is rethinking from the ground up how your business, with its many customers, scales with Weaviate. ### Ease of use of your favorite Weaviate features Weaviate’s new multi-tenancy mode is opt-in. If you don’t require it, there are no changes for you.* **Cost-efficiency**: With usage peaking around tax season but most tenants inactive for many days of the month, ACME shouldn’t have to pay for a large setup that is essentially idle most of the time. * **Diversity of tenants**: ACME has both large and small customers. Their setup needs to be able to handle tenants of vastly different sizes. While most tenants are small, a few tenants can make up a large bulk of the data. ## A time before multi-tenancy support Before Weaviate `v1.20`, you had two options to model a multi-tenancy landscape.--- title: Multi-Tenancy Vector Search with millions of tenants slug: multi-tenancy-vector-search authors: [etienne] date: 2023-06-15 image: ./img/hero.png tags: ['engineering', 'concepts'] description: \"Learn about the new native multi-tenancy feature\" --- ![Multi-Tenancy ](./img/hero.png) <!-- truncate --> Large-scale setups were always a great reason to choose Weaviate. Last year we wrote about the first time [a Weaviate setup ran with a billion objects & vectors](/blog/sphere-dataset-in-weaviate). What was a mere experiment back then is a regular production case today. But earlier this year, we saw a shift in usage patterns: As we onboarded more and more large-scale and enterprise users, the definition of scale shifted from the number of vectors to the number of individual tenants that can run on a single setup. Previously, Weaviate offered multiple ways to tackle multi-tenancy, but none were intended for a massive scale.\n",

      "\n",
      "Contexts: ### The appeal of Weakly-Suppervised or Self-Supervised learning techniques The list of datasets from the 1B training pairs challenge illustrates the appeal of Weakly Supervised or Self-Supervised Learning techniques. To contrast, Natural Questions is one of the larger Supervised datasets for the Question Answering Task. Natural Questions (NQ) requires humans to derive questions given a Wikipedia context as input. As a result of this slow process, the dataset contains 100,231 question-context-answer tuples… Which is quite impressive, but much smaller than the ~730 million pairs extracted from Reddit without human intervention. ### Scale vs model fit Large-scale and **expensive** models can achieve remarkable abilities with datasets like 730 million Reddit conversations.What I love about all this work, like self-ask, chain of thought, we're developing new querying languages. This is like us inventing SQL, except that we didn't design the database. The database came into being and we have to figure out how to interact with it. That example I mentioned about the IPython interaction, like that's a, again, it's a new querying language. And I honestly thought the most potent part of the self-ask wasn't even necessarily the self-ask part.## How We Got Here First-wave database technology is often called by the acronym SQL—the initials of a ubiquitous query language used to manage relational databases, which are conceptually similar to spreadsheets or tables. Throughout the 1980s, this technology was dominated by companies like Oracle and Microsoft. The second wave of databases is called \"NoSQL\". These are the domain of companies like MongoDB. They store data in different ways, for example, key-value stores, document stores, wide-column stores and graph databases, but what they all have in common is that they're not relational tables.Code: AI can generate cod snippets based on the user’s requirements and create a feedback loop with tests to improve the code over time. 3. AutoCAD drawings: AI could create CAD drawings of buildings based on 3D models and store information about the materials available in the environment, making it easier for architects and engineers to design and plan construction projects. 4. Tesla Configuration: The car’s settings could be personalized based on the user’s driving style and preferences, such as choosing a slow and relaxed drive home versus a fast and sporty one.These databases (like Weaviate) were created specifically to store, manage, and retrieve vector embeddings, and do so faster and more efficiently than traditional databases. While vector search is becoming a popular offering in the database world, many “latched on” solutions don’t meet the requirements of modern AI-native development, from reduced developer experience to problems with speed and accuracy. Which brings us to our next point… ## The market is confusing The AI space is moving fast. And with so many new technologies and vendors, it’s no wonder re:Invent attendees were telling us that they were getting overwhelmed with the options. Luckily, your friendly neighborhood Weaviate crew is here to help.\n",

      "Blog Post: Multi-tenancy is defined as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. It is not just an additional feature, but a fundamental rethinking of how a business, with its many customers, scales. In a multi-tenancy case, a user-defined property in the schema, known as the tenant key, needs to be specified for every operation. This approach to handling multiple users or user groups is not only cost-efficient but also capable of managing tenants of vastly different sizes. Therefore, multi-tenancy is a crucial aspect of modern application design and deployment, particularly for businesses looking to scale efficiently and effectively. Multi-tenancy offers several benefits that make it an attractive feature for businesses. One of the main advantages is its ease of use; all that changes in a multi-tenancy case is the specification of the tenant key for every operation. This allows businesses to continue using their favorite features without any major alterations. Multi-tenancy also promotes cost-efficiency as it eliminates the need for a large setup that is idle most of the time. It accommodates a diversity of tenants, catering to both large and small customers. Speed is another benefit, as narrowing a request down to a single tenant does not require much work. Onboarding and offboarding are also made easy, ensuring that adding or removing a business does not impose a significant computational load. Resource boundaries are maintained, preventing the activities of one tenant from interfering with another. In Weaviate's new version, multi-tenancy is an opt-in feature, allowing businesses to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. Multi-tenancy and single-tenancy are two different ways of managing data in a system. In a single-tenancy setup, each tenant has its own dedicated resources, while in a multi-tenancy setup, multiple tenants share the same resources. Multi-tenancy offers several advantages over single-tenancy. It is cost-efficient as it allows for the optimal use of resources, especially when usage peaks at certain times but remains idle for most of the time. It can handle a diverse range of tenants, from large to small, and ensures that the performance of one tenant does not affect others. It also allows for easy onboarding and offboarding of tenants without putting a significant computational load on the system. With the introduction of native multi-tenancy support in Weaviate v1.20, these benefits are further enhanced. This version allows for scaling to millions of tenants with tens of thousands of active tenants per node, and it also emphasizes compliance and a smooth user experience. Therefore, multi-tenancy is not just an additional feature, but a rethinking of how a business with many customers can scale efficiently. Multi-tenancy is defined as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. In technical terms, when dealing with multi-tenancy, a tenant key is required for every operation. This key is a user-defined property in the schema. Multi-tenancy must be able to handle tenants of vastly different sizes, from small to large. It also needs to be fast, as with millions of tenants, narrowing a request down to a single tenant should not take much work. Onboarding and offboarding should be easy and not put a considerable computational load on the system. Multi-tenancy also allows for resource boundaries, ensuring that the load from one tenant does not interfere with others. It is also cost-efficient, as it allows for usage to peak at certain times without requiring a large setup that is idle most of the time. Weaviate's v1.20 release introduced native multi-tenancy support, which includes features such as GDPR-compliant deletes with one command. Multi-tenancy is a concept in software architecture where a single instance of a software application serves multiple users or user groups, known as tenants. This approach is widely used in real-world applications to achieve cost efficiency and scalability. For instance, ACME Accounting, a company with a diverse range of customers, uses a multi-tenancy setup to efficiently manage its resources. The company requires a system that can quickly process requests from millions of tenants, easily onboard new customers, and set resource boundaries to prevent interference between tenants. Another example of multi-tenancy in real-world applications is the Weaviate software. Its latest version, v1.20, offers native multi-tenancy support that can scale to millions of tenants with tens of thousands of active tenants per node. This feature allows businesses to scale their operations while ensuring compliance and a smooth user experience.\n",
