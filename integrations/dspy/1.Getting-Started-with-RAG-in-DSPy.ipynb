    "# Getting Started with RAG in DSPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to use DSPy to compile a RAG program! DSPy compilation is a fairly new tool for LLM developers, so let's start with an overview of the concept. By `compiling`, we mean finding the prompts that elicit the behavior we want from LLMs when connected in some kind of pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, RAG is a very common LLM pipeline. In it's simplest form, RAG consists of 2 steps, (1) Retrieve and (2) Answer a Question. Part (2), Answering a Question, has an associated prompt, for example, people generally use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "Please answer the question based on the following context.\n",
    "\n",
    "context  {context}\n",
    "\n",
    "question {question}\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt may be a good initial point for an LLM to understand the task. However, it is not the *optimal* prompt. DSPy optimizes the prompt for you by jointly (1) tweaking the instructions, such as rewriting an initial prompt like: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please answer the question based on the following context.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Assess the context and answer the given questions that are predominantly about software usage, process optimization, and troubleshooting. Focus on providing accurate information related to tech or software-related queries.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, DSPy (2) finds examples of desired input-outputs in the prompt to further improve performance, also known as `In-Context Learning`. In this example, we will begin with the simple prompt: `Please answer the question based on the following context.` and end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to leverage black-box optimization techniques like random search, bayesian optimization, or evolutionary algorithms, we need a metric. Coming up with metrics to describe desired system behavior has been a longstanding challenge in Machine Learning research. Excitingly, LLMs have made amazing progress. For example, we can evaluate a RAG answer by prompting an LLM with, `Is the assessed text grounded in the context? Say no if it includes significant facts not in the context`. We then optimize the RAG program to increase the metric LLM's assessment of answer quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example contains 4 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0: DSPy Settings and Installation\n",
    "- 1: DSPy Datasets with `dspy.Example`\n",
    "- 2: LLM Metrics in DSPy\n",
    "- 3: LLM Programming with `dspy.Module`\n",
    "- 4: Optimization with `BootstrapFewShot`, `BootstrapFewShotRandomSearch`, and `BayesianSignatureOptimizer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using 2 datasets for this example. Firstly, we have an index of the Weaviate Blog Posts. We will use the Weaviate Blog Posts as the retrieved context to help with our second dataset, the Weaviate FAQs. The Weaviate FAQs consists of 44 question-answer pairs of frequently asked Weaviate questions such as: `Do I need to know about Docker (Compose) to use Weaviate?`\n",
    "\n",
    "We isolate 10 examples to use as our test set and optimize our program with the remaining 34.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our uncompiled RAG program achieves a score of 270 on the held-out test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our RAG program compiled with the `BayesianSignatureOptimizer` achieves a score of 340! A ~30% improvement!"

      "Cross Encoders are one of the most well known ranking models for content-based re-ranking. There is quite a collection of pre-trained cross encoders available on [sentence transformers](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_cross-encoders.html). We are currently envisioning interfacing cross encoders with Weaviate using the following syntax.»\n",
      "[2] «Thus, quality at the expense of speed, becomes more interesting. ### LLMs as Cross Encoders\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let’s dive into the LLM hype a little more, how can we use LLMs for re-ranking? There are generally 2 ways to do this. The first strategy is identical to the cross encoder, we give the LLM the [query, document] input and prompt it to output a score of how relevant the document is to the query. The tricky thing with this is bounding the score.»\n",
      "[3] «They offer the advantage of further reasoning about the relevance of results without needing specialized training. Cross Encoders can be interfaced with Weaviate to re-rank search results, trading off performance for slower search speed. * **Metadata Rankers** are context-based re-rankers that use symbolic features to rank relevance. They take into account user and document features, such as age, gender, location, preferences, release year, genre, and box office, to predict the relevance of candidate documents. By incorporating metadata features, these rankers offer a more personalized and context-aware search experience.»\n",
      "[4] «These kinds of models are increasingly being used as guardrails for generative models. For example, a harmful or NSFW content detector can prevent these generations from making it through the search pipeline. An interesting idea I recently heard from Eddie Zhou on Jerry Liu’s Llama Index Fireside Chat is the idea of using Natural Language Inference models to prevent hallucination by predicting the entailment or contradiction taking as the [retrieved context, generated output] as input. Because large language models are stochastic models, we can sample several candidate generations and filter them through score rankers like these. ## A Recap of the Ranking Models\n",
      "* **Cross Encoders** are content-based re-ranking models that utilize pre-trained models, such as those available on Sentence Transformers, to rank the relevance of documents.»\n",

This fishing example explains the concept of coarse-grained retrieval (fishing net = vector search / bm25) and manual inspection of the fish (fishermen = ranking models). Depicted with manual inspection of fish, the main cost of ranking models is speed. In March, Bob van Luijt appeared on a Cohere panel to discuss [“AI and The Future of Search”](https://twitter.com/cohereai/status/1636396916157079554?s=46&t=Zzg6vgh4rwmYEkdV-3v5gg).

      "Cross Encoders are one of the most well known ranking models for content-based re-ranking. There is quite a collection of pre-trained cross encoders available on [sentence transformers](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_cross-encoders.html). We are currently envisioning interfacing cross encoders with Weaviate using the following syntax.»\n",
      "[2] «Thus, quality at the expense of speed, becomes more interesting. ### LLMs as Cross Encoders\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let’s dive into the LLM hype a little more, how can we use LLMs for re-ranking? There are generally 2 ways to do this. The first strategy is identical to the cross encoder, we give the LLM the [query, document] input and prompt it to output a score of how relevant the document is to the query. The tricky thing with this is bounding the score.»\n",
      "[3] «They offer the advantage of further reasoning about the relevance of results without needing specialized training. Cross Encoders can be interfaced with Weaviate to re-rank search results, trading off performance for slower search speed. * **Metadata Rankers** are context-based re-rankers that use symbolic features to rank relevance. They take into account user and document features, such as age, gender, location, preferences, release year, genre, and box office, to predict the relevance of candidate documents. By incorporating metadata features, these rankers offer a more personalized and context-aware search experience.»\n",
      "[4] «These kinds of models are increasingly being used as guardrails for generative models. For example, a harmful or NSFW content detector can prevent these generations from making it through the search pipeline. An interesting idea I recently heard from Eddie Zhou on Jerry Liu’s Llama Index Fireside Chat is the idea of using Natural Language Inference models to prevent hallucination by predicting the entailment or contradiction taking as the [retrieved context, generated output] as input. Because large language models are stochastic models, we can sample several candidate generations and filter them through score rankers like these. ## A Recap of the Ranking Models\n",

This fishing example explains the concept of coarse-grained retrieval (fishing net = vector search / bm25) and manual inspection of the fish (fishermen = ranking models). Depicted with manual inspection of fish, the main cost of ranking models is speed. In March, Bob van Luijt appeared on a Cohere panel to discuss [“AI and The Future of Search”](https://twitter.com/cohereai/status/1636396916157079554?s=46&t=Zzg6vgh4rwmYEkdV-3v5gg).

You *simply* had to (*inhales deeply*) develop a vectorization algorithm, vectorize the data, build a vector index, build a database with the underlying data, integrate the vector index with the database, then forward results from a vector index query to the database and combine the outputs from both (*exhales*).»\n",

      "Just the simple act of enabling replication on a Weaviate cluster will provide huge benefits. Doing so might actually be simpler than you might imagine. ### How to enable replication on Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)\n",
      "\n",
      "Enabling replication on a Weaviate Cloud Services cluster is as simple as selecting the `Enable High Availability` button at cluster creation time. (Not available on sandboxes.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This will enable a multi-node configuration in Weaviate and ensures that each class is configured with the appropriate replication factor. ### How to enable replication on self-deployed Weaviate\n",
      "\n",
      "Enabling replication in a self-deployment setup such as a Docker or Kubernetes setup involves the following two steps.»\n",
      "[2] «For sure it might not be for everybody and every use case. But if you are using Weaviate at scale, in production, we believe enabling it will add significant value and encourage you to consider its use.»\n",
      "[3] «The data is persisted, so you can use it from future invocations, or you can [transfer it to another instance](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/read-all-objects/#restore-to-a-target-instance). You can learn more about running Weaviate locally from client code on the [Embedded Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded/) page. ## <i class=\"fa-solid fa-lightbulb\"></i> Use cases\n",
      "\n",
      "What can you do with Embedded Weaviate? Quite a few things!\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, you can get started very quickly with Weaviate on your local machine, without having to explicitly download, install or instantiate a server. ### Jupyter notebooks\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also use Embedded Weaviate from Jupyter notebooks, including on Google Colaboratory.»\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Do I need to know about Docker (Compose) to use Weaviate?\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We need to determine if knowledge of Docker (Compose) is necessary to use Weaviate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: No, knowledge of Docker (Compose) is not necessary to use Weaviate. According to the given context, enabling replication in a self-deployment setup such as Docker or Kubernetes involves two steps, but it is not explicitly mentioned that knowledge of Docker (Compose) is required.\n",

      "Cross Encoders are one of the most well known ranking models for content-based re-ranking. There is quite a collection of pre-trained cross encoders available on [sentence transformers](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_cross-encoders.html). We are currently envisioning interfacing cross encoders with Weaviate using the following syntax.»\n",
      "[2] «Thus, quality at the expense of speed, becomes more interesting. ### LLMs as Cross Encoders\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let’s dive into the LLM hype a little more, how can we use LLMs for re-ranking? There are generally 2 ways to do this. The first strategy is identical to the cross encoder, we give the LLM the [query, document] input and prompt it to output a score of how relevant the document is to the query. The tricky thing with this is bounding the score.»\n",
      "[3] «They offer the advantage of further reasoning about the relevance of results without needing specialized training. Cross Encoders can be interfaced with Weaviate to re-rank search results, trading off performance for slower search speed. * **Metadata Rankers** are context-based re-rankers that use symbolic features to rank relevance. They take into account user and document features, such as age, gender, location, preferences, release year, genre, and box office, to predict the relevance of candidate documents. By incorporating metadata features, these rankers offer a more personalized and context-aware search experience.»\n",

For text, vectorization techniques have evolved tremendously over the last decade, from the venerable [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) ([2013](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)), to the state-of-the-art transformer models era, spurred by the release of [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) in [2018](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html). ### Word-level dense vector models (word2vec, GloVe, etc.)\n",

By prompting this ranking with “please output the ranking as a dictionary of IDs with the key equal to the rank and the value equal to the document id”. Also interesting is the question around how many documents we can rank like this and how expensive it is.

The certainty value in Weaviate represents the confidence level of the result, but it is not equivalent to cosine similarity.

      "[2] «Weaviate generates vector embeddings using [modules](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules) (OpenAI, Cohere, Google PaLM etc.), and conveniently stores both objects and vectors in the same database. For example, vectorizing the two words above might result in:\n",

The certainty value in Weaviate represents the confidence level of the result, but it is not equivalent to cosine similarity. Cosine similarity is a measure of the similarity between two vectors, while certainty in Weaviate is a measure of confidence in the result. To calculate cosine similarity, you would need to compare the vector embeddings of the objects using a specific algorithm or library.\n",

      "* increased memory requirements: context-sensitivity greatly increases memory requirements, which often leads to limited possible input lengths\n",

      "Despite these downsides, transformer models have been wildly successful. Countless text vectorizer models have proliferated over the recent past. Plus, many more vectorizer models exist for other data types such as audio, video and images, to name a few.»\n",
      "[3] «Further these approaches are well positioned to generalize to Recommendation. In Recommendation, instead of taking a [query, document] as input to a cross-encoder, we take as input a [user description, document] pair. For example, we can ask users to describe their preferences. Further, we could combine these in trios of [user description, query, item] for LLM, or more lightweight cross-encoder, ranking.

The database came into being and we have to figure out how to interact with it. That example I mentioned about the IPython interaction, like that's a, again, it's a new querying language.

The tricky thing with this is bounding the score.»\n",

Cross Encoders can be interfaced with Weaviate to re-rank search results, trading off performance for slower search speed. * **Metadata Rankers** are context-based re-rankers that use symbolic features to rank relevance. They take into account user and document features, such as age, gender, location, preferences, release year, genre, and box office, to predict the relevance of candidate documents.
