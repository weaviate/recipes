      "\n",
      "1. Indexing: Creating an index data structure that organizes the data points can significantly speed up the search. Popular indexing methods include KD-trees, Ball-trees, and Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs. These data structures divide the high-dimensional space and provide efficient ways to navigate and narrow down the search region.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Hashing: Hashing techniques transform high-dimensional data points into a shorter binary code. This enables faster comparisons between data points. Methods like Product Quantization and Hierarchical Navigable Hash Tables (HNHT) can further accelerate the search process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Graph-based Methods: These methods construct a graph that connects nearby points in the data space. Algorithms such as the Hierarchical Dual Tree and the Nearest Neighbor Graph (NNG) can find approximate nearest neighbors by traversing the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH): LSH is a popular technique that uses random projections to map similar data points to the same hash buckets. This enables efficient similarity searches, especially in high-dimensional spaces.\n",

      "5. Quantization: This technique involves representing data points with a smaller number of quantized values. Product Quantization and Scalar Quantization are two approaches that reduce the dimensionality of the search space, making the search more manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Hierarchical Navigation: Hierarchical methods divide the data into a hierarchy of clusters or regions. Nearest neighbor searches can be performed efficiently by navigating through the hierarchy and focusing on specific clusters or areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Machine Learning-based Approaches: Some algorithms learn the intrinsic structure of the data and use this knowledge to speed up the ANN search. Deep learning models, such as the Navigation Net, can be trained to predict rough locations of nearest neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Approximate Distance Calculations: Instead of computing exact distances, which can be computationally expensive, using approximate distance measures can save time. Techniques like SDHash provide fast and reasonably accurate distance estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the dimensionality of the data can make the search space smaller and less complex. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can aid in this process.\n",

The **most popular use case of vector search engines is naturally for search**. Because a vector database can help find similar objects, it is predestined for applications where you might want to find similar products, movies, books, songs, etc. That’s why vector search engines are also **used in recommendation systems** as a restated task of search. With the rise of LLMs, **vector databases have already been used to enhance modern Generative AI applications**.\n",

In fact, when profiling Weaviate indexed using HNSW, we find that 40%-60% of the CPU time is spent doing vector distance calculations.

We enabled PQ to reduce the memory requirements without slowing down the ingestion. You can either [manually](/developers/weaviate/configuration/pq-compression#manually-configure-pq) enable PQ or have it [automatically triggered](/developers/weaviate/configuration/pq-compression#configure-autopq) based on the number of vectors.\n",

      "\n",
      "A couple weeks back in our blog on [ChatGPT plugins](/blog/weaviate-retrieval-plugin) we talked about the potential for plugins to help expand ChatGPT’s functionality by allowing it to leverage third-party resources to act upon the conversations that you have with it. The value for these plugins is greatest when they help make up for a current short-coming that ChatGPT has. For example ChatGPT is built on top of GPT 4.0 which is a large language model which doesn’t understand mathematical and algebraic reasoning as well as it does written language and thus using the WolframAlpha plugin as a “math-mode” when needing to solve mathematical problems makes perfect sense!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another short-coming of ChatGPT we spoke about was that it lacks the use of context in answering your questions unless this context is specifically conveyed in the body of the prompt. The solution to this shortcoming was the [ChatGPT retrieval plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin) which connects ChatGPT to a [vector database](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database) which provides a robust solution to the above problem. The vector database connected to ChatGPT can be used to store and refer to relevant information when answering prompts and acts as longterm memory of the LLM.\n",

      "\n",
      "Because of its search capabilities, a vector database is sometimes also called a vector search engine. This section introduces the core concepts of vector databases. We will discuss what vector embeddings are, how they enable similarity search, and how they accelerate it. ### Vector Embeddings\n",
      "\n",
      "When you think of data, you probably think of neatly organized numbers in spreadsheets. This type of data is called structured data because it can easily be stored in tabular format.\n",
      "[23] In this article, we will cover the need for disk-based solutions, explore Vamana (how it works and contrast it against HNSW), and present the result of Vamana implementation. > If you are new to vector databases and ANN, I recommend you to read \"[Why is Vector Search so Fast?](/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast)\"<br/>\n",
      "> The article explains what vector databases are and how they work. ## Need for approximation\n",
      "In order for a vector database to efficiently search through a vast number of vectors, the database needs to be smart about it. A brute-force approach would calculate the distance between the query vector and every data vector in the queried collection, but this is computationally very expensive. For a database with millions of objects and thousands of high-dimensional vectors, this would take far too long.\n",
      "[24] ### Indexing Knobs\n",
      "For the sake of designing RAG systems, the most important indexing knob looks like vector compression settings. Launched in March 2023, Weaviate 1.18 introduced Product Quantization (PQ). PQ is a vector compression algorithm that groups contiguous segments of a vector, clusters their values across the collection, and then reduces the precision with centroids. For example, a contiguous segment of 4 32-bit floats requires 16 bytes to represent, a segment length of 4 with 8 centroids results in only needing 1 byte, a 16:1 memory reduction. Recent advances in PQ Rescoring help significantly with recall loss from this compression, but is still an important consideration with very high levels of compression.\n",
      "[25] And that Weaviate recently added a new algorithm for how this is done? In this post, we’ll dive into exactly the world of hybrid search to discuss how it works, how results are produced, the algorithms used, and more. So let’s get into it!\n",

      "Vector libraries are commonly used for applications that do not have changing data. For example, academic information retrieval benchmarks are designed to test performance on a **static snapshot** of data. When plugging an ANN index into production-ready applications, databases offer many appealing features not found in a library. <img\n",

      "One of the core features that set vector databases apart from libraries is the ability to store and update your data. Vector databases have full **CRUD** (create, read, update, and delete) support that solves the limitations of a vector library.\n",
      "[28] Finding information you are looking for and providing recommendations is possible because knowledge and information is placed in context. ## How does Weaviate work? Data usually refers to something in the real world. Traditional databases and search engines often struggle with understanding the context of data, a situation or a search query. The context of data is important, because it enables storage and search by fuzzy concepts instead of exact matching keywords.\n",
      "[29] These databases (like Weaviate) were created specifically to store, manage, and retrieve vector embeddings, and do so faster and more efficiently than traditional databases. While vector search is becoming a popular offering in the database world, many “latched on” solutions don’t meet the requirements of modern AI-native development, from reduced developer experience to problems with speed and accuracy. Which brings us to our next point…\n",

      "[30] Each vector dimension dictates the colour gradient on the heatmap. The image below shows the same vector, but we threshold the vector such that all positive valued dimensions are turned into 1(white) and negative valued dimensions are turned to 0(black). As a result, we get a black-and-white heatmap that looks kind of like a bar code. This is what the process of binary quantization looks like for vector embeddings!

      "[34] Because search in traditional databases relies on keyword matches, you would have to create a big query that queries all animals (e.g., contains \"dog\", or contains \"cat\", or contains \"wolf\", etc.). With semantic search, you could simply query for the concept of \"animals\". ![Traditional search vs. vector search](img/Traditional_Search_X_Vector_Search.jpg)\n",
      "\n",
      "Because most vector databases do not only store vector embeddings but store them together with the original source data, they are not only capable of vector search but also enable traditional keyword search. Some vector databases like [Weaviate](http://weaviate.io) even support [hybrid search](https://weaviate.io/blog/hybrid-search-explained) capabilities that combine vector search with keyword search.\n",
      "[35] Then, we will dive into the technical details of how distance metrics are used in vector search and how vector indexes enable efficient retrieval. Once we have a fundamental understanding of vector databases, we will discuss their use cases and the current tool landscape. ## What is a Vector Database? A vector database indexes, stores, and provides access to structured or unstructured data (e.g., text or images) alongside its [vector embeddings](https://weaviate.io/blog/vector-embeddings-explained), which are the data's numerical representation. It allows users to find and retrieve similar objects quickly at scale in production.\n",
      "[36] Here is an example [demo](https://github.com/weaviate/healthsearch-demo) called [HealthSearch](https://weaviate.io/blog/healthsearch-demo) of a [Weaviate](http://weaviate.io) vector database in action together with an LLM showcasing the potential of leveraging user-written reviews and queries to retrieve supplement products based on specific health effects. ![example-use-case-llm-vector-database](../2023-07-26-healthsearch-blogpost/img/hero.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tool Landscape around Vector Databases\n",
      "\n",
      "Although vector databases are AI-native and specifically designed to handle vector embeddings and enable efficient vector search, alternatives like [vector libraries](https://weaviate.io/blog/vector-library-vs-vector-database) and vector-capable databases exist as well. ### Vector Database vs. Traditional (Relational) Database\n",
      "\n",
      "The main difference between a traditional (relational) database and a modern vector database comes from the type of data they were optimized for. While a relational database is designed to store structured data in columns, a vector database is also optimized to store unstructured data (e.g., text, images, or audio) and their vector embeddings.\n",
      "[37] Because vector databases and relational databases are optimized for different types of data, they also differ in the way data is stored and retrieved. In a relational database, data is stored in columns and retrieved by keyword matches in traditional search. In contrast, vector databases also store the vector embeddings of the original data, which enables efficient semantic search. Because vector search is capable of semantic understanding your search terms, it doesn't rely on retrieving relevant search results based on exact matches, which makes it robust to typos and synonyms. For example, imagine you have a database that stores Jeopardy questions, and you want to retrieve all questions that contain an animal.\n",
      "[38] For example, the vector for bananas (both the text and the image) is located near apples and not cats. <img\n",
      "  src={require('./img/vectors-example.png').default}\n",

      "/>\n",
      "\n",
      "*The above image is a visual representation of a vector space. To perform a search, your search query is converted to a vector - similar to your data vectors. The vector database then computes the similarity between the search query and the collection of data points in the vector space.*\n",
      "\n",
      "### Vector Databases are Fast\n",
      "\n",
      "The best thing is, vector databases can **query large datasets**, containing **tens or hundreds of millions of objects** and still **respond** to queries in a tiny **fraction of a second**. Without getting too much into details, one of the big reasons why vector databases are so fast is because they use the **Approximate Nearest Neighbor** (ANN) algorithm to index data based on vectors.\n",
      "[39] This is why we have **Vector Databases** and **Vector Libraries**. They both use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithm to search through vectors in a tiny fraction of the time. You can learn more about this topic from [\"Why Vectors Search is so Fast.\"](/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast)\n",

      "## The Big Question\n",
      "So, if both vector databases and vector libraries allow you to efficiently search through your vectors. What are the key differences between them, and why/when should you choose one over the other? ## Vector Libraries\n",
      "Vector libraries store vector embeddings in in-memory indexes, in order to perform similarity search.\n",
      "[40] ## More Coming Soon\n",
      "We are very excited about the potential of Ref2Vec, and how it leverages existing symbolic data to augment vector searches in a new way. One of my favorite articles about Weaviate is Bob van Luijt's [\"The AI-First Database Ecosystem\"](/blog/semantic-search-with-wikipedia-and-weaviate). In this article, Bob describes emerging **waves** of database technology; from SQL, to NoSQL, and now, AI-first databases that focus \"on data that is processed by a machine learning model first, where the AI models help in processing, storing and searching through the data as opposed to traditional ways\". Although Weaviate puts Machine Learning data representations first, **this doesn't mean we discard symbolic data and many features of previous systems**.

      "Vector databases’ search capabilities can be used in various applications ranging from classical Machine Learning use cases, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender systems, to providing long-term memory to LLMs in modern applications. The **most popular use case of vector search engines is naturally for search**. Because a vector database can help find similar objects, it is predestined for applications where you might want to find similar products, movies, books, songs, etc. That’s why vector search engines are also **used in recommendation systems** as a restated task of search. With the rise of LLMs, **vector databases have already been used to enhance modern Generative AI applications**.»\n",
      "[5] «Depending on the data type, vector embeddings are created using machine learning models that are able to translate the meaning of an object into a numerical representation in a high dimensional space. Thus, there are a variety of machine learning models able to create a variety of different types of embeddings, such as word embeddings, sentence embeddings, text embeddings, or image embeddings. Vector embeddings capture the semantic relationship between data objects in numerical values and thus, you can find similar data points by determining their nearest neighbors in the high dimensional vector space. This concept is also called similarity search and can be applied in different applications, such as text search, image search, or recommendation systems.

      "Question: Why might vector libraries not be suitable for applications that require real-time updates and scalable semantic search?\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to Reasoning: Let's break down the question and identify the key points to address. First, we need to understand the capabilities and limitations of vector libraries. Then, we can assess why they may not be suitable for certain use cases. Vector libraries are designed to store vector embeddings of data objects, and they do so in in-memory indexes. This provides fast vector search capabilities. However, there are two main limitations to consider: 1. **Scalability**: Vector libraries cannot be queried while importing data. This becomes a bottleneck for applications that deal with large amounts of data, especially in the billions of objects. The library has to finish importing all the data before any queries can be made, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. 2. **Updatability**: The vector library indexes are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. This results in an inability to perform real-time updates. Any changes to the data would require recreating the entire index, which is impractical for applications that require dynamic data updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Vector libraries may not be suitable for applications that require real-time updates and scalable semantic search due to their limitations in updatability and scalability. The immutable nature of vector library indexes prevents real-time updates, and the lack of query capabilities during data import affects their scalability for large datasets. Therefore, applications that demand dynamic data changes and efficient handling of vast amounts of data would be better served by alternative solutions, such as vector databases.\n",

It includes code snippets and explanations for various steps, such as defining the database schema, running queries, and implementing endpoints for a retrieval plugin. Question: How do you test semantic search functionality and result consistency using `text2vec-openai`? Reasoning: To test the semantic search functionality and result consistency using `text2vec-openai`, we need to follow the steps outlined in the context. First, we define the database schema, including the fields that will be vectorized, such as \"ingredients,\" \"description,\" and \"effects.\" Then, we can run queries using the `nearText` search parameter to perform semantic searches. In the example given, the query searches for \"chemistry\" and expects the top result to be about \"sodium.\" We can also specify the distance parameter to control the relevance of the results. To test the consistency of the results, we can use assertions in our test code. In the provided code snippet, the `test_query` function asserts that the length of the results is equal to the specified limit and that the query term (\"lion\" in this case) is present in the text of each result. By running this test for different queries and comparing the results, we can evaluate the consistency of the semantic search functionality.\n",

      "These days, more and more organizations are adopting a data-driven culture. Business processes and customer experience benefit from good data collection, management and analysis. But in order to really benefit from available data, it is essential to also understand the unstructured data, like free text in PDF documents, emails, invoices or voice transcriptions. Unstructured data is especially hard to index, manage and understand.»\n",
      "[4] «Since around [80% of all data is unstructured](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/29/the-80-blind-spot-are-you-ignoring-unstructured-organizational-data/), it is hard to actually search and retrieve insights from most of the data. The Weaviate vector database unlocks the potential of unstructured data. Searching by fuzzy terms and classification of rich data like free text becomes possible with Weaviate. It uses AI-driven indexing and search technologies to enable real-time text processing. With machine learning methods, Weaviate automatically classifies texts.»\n",

      "Question: What is Ref2Vec, and how does it integrate with Weaviate to provide real-time user-based recommendations?\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to understand what Ref2Vec is and how it works with Weaviate to deliver real-time recommendations based on user behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Ref2Vec, or reference-to-vector, is a technique that enables the vectorization of a data object by leveraging its cross-references to other objects. In simple terms, it calculates vectors that represent a user's interactions with different items or classes. This is achieved by aggregating the representations of the referenced objects to create a vector for the referencing object. In the given context, Ref2Vec is used to capture a user's preferences and actions on an e-commerce platform. Now, how does Ref2Vec integrate with Weaviate to provide real-time user-based recommendations? Weaviate is a vector database and search engine that can power high-quality, fast recommendations. Ref2Vec enhances Weaviate's capabilities by allowing it to learn from user behavior and preferences in real time. When a user interacts with multiple items on an e-commerce platform (for example, clicking on shoe images), Ref2Vec calculates a vector that represents the user's interest in that particular category or style. This vector is created by aggregating the vectors of the referenced products (the shoes the user clicked on). By integrating Ref2Vec with Weaviate, the system can dynamically update user vectors based on their interactions and preferences. This enables Weaviate to provide relevant and personalized recommendations in real time. For instance, if a user has purchased or shown interest in boots, shorts, and a Weaviate t-shirt, Ref2Vec can aggregate these product representations to characterize the user's overall style preferences. As a result, Weaviate can offer recommendations that align closely with the user's tastes, improving their shopping experience. In summary, Ref2Vec enables the vectorization of user preferences by aggregating their interactions with various items. This information is then used by Weaviate to update user vectors in real time, leading to more accurate and personalized recommendations. The combination of Ref2Vec and Weaviate thus enhances the user experience by delivering relevant and timely suggestions based on their behavior and interests.\n",

      "\n",
      "Answer: The syntax differences between the classic client and the collections client for accessing data object properties are as follows: Classic Client: - Uses a chain of methods with the `with_` prefix, such as `with_limit` and `with_generate`, to specify query parameters. - Requires specifying the collection name in every request. - Uses a builder pattern for queries. - Requires using the `?` operator for optional chaining and the `['_additional']` index due to the underscore in the key name. - Accesses properties using bracket notation, such as `response['data']['Get']['Article'][0]['title']`. Collections Client: - Uses standalone methods with parameters, such as `fetch_objects` and `generate.near_text`, to perform queries. - Does not require specifying the collection name in every request. Instead, a collection object is created and used for subsequent requests. - Simplifies the syntax by removing the need for the `?` operator and the `['_additional']` index. - Accesses properties using dot notation, such as `response.objects[0].properties['title']`. - Introduces types for data objects, allowing direct access to their properties. - Returns most properties and metadata by default, including object IDs, creation times, and vector search distances. The collections client aims to improve readability, reduce errors, and increase productivity by simplifying the syntax and introducing standalone methods.

They require less computational power (<30% of DALL-E) while producing higher-quality images that are more faithful to the retrieved context.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced method to enhance traditional search techniques by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to help identify and summarize answers. Instead of having to manually comb through documents to find an answer, a RAG system allows you to retrieve relevant sources and return a response in natural, conversational language.»\n",

      "Question: What is Retrieval Augmented Generation and what are its common applications?\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to Reasoning: Let's break down the context to understand Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and its common applications. First, the context mentions that RAG is a technique used in search engines and information retrieval systems. It is described as an advanced method that enhances traditional search techniques by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM). The main idea behind RAG is to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results by combining information retrieval techniques with the power of LLMs. By using an LLM, RAG systems can identify and summarize answers from relevant sources, providing users with more concise and personalized responses. Now, let's identify the common applications of RAG: - **Search Engines**: RAG is particularly useful for search engines, where the goal is to provide users with the most relevant and accurate results for their queries. By incorporating RAG techniques, search engines can offer more personalized and contextually relevant answers, enhancing the user experience. - **Question Answering Systems**: RAG is ideal for question-answering systems, where the goal is to provide direct answers to user queries. By retrieving relevant sources and using LLMs to generate responses, RAG systems can offer more accurate and contextually rich answers. - **Information Retrieval Applications**: Any application that involves retrieving information from a large corpus of data can benefit from RAG. This includes document retrieval systems, knowledge bases, and content recommendation engines. RAG enables these applications to provide more targeted and relevant results to users. - **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks**: RAG can be applied to various NLP tasks beyond just question answering. It can be used for text summarization, information extraction, sentiment analysis, and language understanding tasks, where the ability to retrieve relevant context is crucial.\n",

      "When discussing solutions made for many users, our first intuition is to worry about how we onboard and serve them. But deleting them is equally important – both for technical and legal reasons. Take GDPR as an example.»\n",
      "[2] «You can easily run with 50,000+ active shards per node. With just 20 nodes, you can support 1M concurrently active tenants. And with support for inactive tenants (coming soon - read below), there is no limit per node at all. ### Fast and efficient querying\n",

With a median tenant storing between 1,000 and 100,000 objects, you would typically query less than 0.01% of the index. What a waste of resources. Additionally, dropping many tenants simultaneously would lead to expensive repair operations on the shared index. Resource isolation for tenants was also not possible.»\n",

Each tenant is a separate shard in Weaviate, giving you high guarantees of isolation between data. This feature is ideal if you have different customers where each wants to load data into your enterprise application, but don’t want cross pollination of results between those tenants. The Weaviate multi tenancy scales to millions of tenants.

We know from the context that Weaviate offers a way to use Hugging Face modules without having to run the Inference API directly. The process is described as straightforward, and we can identify the key steps to follow: - Weaviate includes a Hugging Face module that provides support for Hugging Face Inference. This is available from version 1.15 onwards. - The Hugging Face module delegates the model inference tasks to the Hugging Face Inference service. - To use the module, one needs to set 'text2vec-huggingface' as the default vectorizer in the configuration. - An API token from Hugging Face is also required, which can be obtained from their website. - With these settings in place, Weaviate coordinates the data imports, updates, and queries, communicating with the Hugging Face Inference API on the user's behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: To use Hugging Face modules with Weaviate without running the Inference API yourself, follow these steps: 1. Ensure you are using Weaviate version 1.15 or newer. 2. Set 'text2vec-huggingface' as the default vectorizer in your Weaviate configuration. 3. Obtain a Hugging Face API token from the Hugging Face website. 4. Provide your API token when setting up the Hugging Face module in Weaviate. 5. With these settings, Weaviate will handle the communication with the Hugging Face Inference API, allowing you to focus on your application's requirements.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We can refer to the provided context, which outlines the process of setting up the Weaviate instance with the 'text2vec-huggingface' module. Firstly, it is mentioned that to use the Hugging Face module in Weaviate open source, one needs to set 'text2vec-huggingface' as the default vectorizer in the configuration file (usually YAML). This is a crucial step to ensure Weaviate uses the correct module for vectorization. Secondly, the context provides a step-by-step guide, comparing the process to following a recipe in a cooking class. It emphasizes the need for specific 'ingredients', which include raw data, a Hugging Face API token, and a working Weaviate instance with the 'text2vec-huggingface' module enabled. Thirdly, the guide instructs users to define their schema, including class names, properties, and data types. This is a standard procedure when working with structured data in Weaviate. As part of the schema definition, users need to specify which Hugging Face model they want to use for each schema class. This is achieved by adding a 'moduleConfig' property to the schema, where the desired model name is provided. Finally, the context mentions that Weaviate 'v1.15' and newer versions include the Hugging Face module, which provides support for Hugging Face Inference straight from the vector database. This implies that ensuring the Weaviate instance is updated to the latest version is essential for accessing the Hugging Face module. With these steps in mind, we can now formulate a response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: To set up a Weaviate instance with the 'text2vec-huggingface' module, follow these steps: 1. Ensure you have the necessary ingredients: raw data to work with, a Hugging Face API token (obtainable from their website), and a functioning Weaviate instance. 2. Configure your Weaviate instance by setting 'text2vec-huggingface' as the default vectorizer in the configuration file. 3. Define your schema, including class names, properties, and data types. As part of this step, specify the desired Hugging Face model for each schema class by adding a 'moduleConfig' property to the schema definition. 4. Update your Weaviate instance to the latest version ('v1.15' or newer) to access the built-in Hugging Face module, which facilitates Hugging Face Inference straight from the vector database. By following these steps, you can effectively set up Weaviate to utilize the 'text2vec-huggingface' module for vectorization and model inference tasks.\n",

Because a vector database can help find similar objects, it is predestined for applications where you might want to find similar products, movies, books, songs, etc. That’s why vector search engines are also **used in recommendation systems** as a restated task of search.

As the input sequence length increases, so do the processing power and memory needs, which can be a significant hurdle even for powerful computing systems. The `CombineDocuments` chain is introduced as a solution to this problem. It is a technique used to decompose large texts into manageable segments that can be more easily processed by LLMs. By taking portions of the chat history and user input, the `CombineDocuments` chain reformulates the question into a standalone query that can be answered using a smaller context window. Additionally, the context mentions that vector databases, such as Weaviate, are used in conjunction with LLMs to enhance their capabilities.

      "Answer: Vector libraries and vector databases like Weaviate differ in several ways: 1. Filtering: Vector databases support filtering in combination with vector search, while vector libraries do not. 2. Updatability: Vector databases offer CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing real-time updates. Vector libraries, on the other hand, have immutable index data, making updates impossible. 3. Incremental Importing: Vector databases support incremental importing and concurrent reading while importing. While some vector libraries may offer this feature (e.g., hnswlib), it is not a standard capability. 4. Storage: Vector databases store both objects and vectors, whereas vector libraries only store vector embeddings. 5. Speed: Vector libraries are typically faster than full-blown databases due to their in-memory nature. Vector databases are optimized for the end-to-end call stack, which includes various operations beyond just vector search. 6. Performance Optimization: Vector libraries are optimized for in-memory similarity search, making them efficient for specific tasks. Vector databases, on the other hand, are optimized for the entire end-to-end call stack, including vector search, object retrieval, filtering, and network requests. In summary, vector libraries are suitable for applications with static data and in-memory similarity search requirements. Vector databases, like Weaviate, are preferred when you need to store objects and vectors together, perform updates, and have additional features like filtering and CRUD operations.\n",

GOMEMLIMIT is a \"soft\" limit introduced in the Go programming language to optimize memory usage and prevent out-of-memory (OOM) situations. It is a target value that guides the garbage collector (GC) but is not strictly enforced. When the live heap is low: - GOMEMLIMIT allows the GC cycle to be delayed. The GC runs less frequently, conserving resources and improving performance. - The GC is more relaxed, as there is plenty of memory available, and it can take its time to collect and manage memory efficiently. When the live heap is near the limit: - GOMEMLIMIT triggers the GC to run more often. It becomes more aggressive to prevent an OOM situation. - The GC tries to keep the memory usage below the soft limit, sacrificing some CPU time if needed. It becomes a conscious trade-off between memory usage and CPU usage. - The goal of the GC is no longer to double the live heap but to stay barely above it, ensuring that memory usage remains within manageable limits.\n",

      "Answer: GOMEMLIMIT plays a crucial role in optimizing garbage collection cycles by providing a target memory limit. When the live heap is low, GOMEMLIMIT delays GC cycles and allows for a more relaxed collection.

This adaptive behavior ensures efficient memory management and prevents potential crashes due to memory constraints.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the most outstanding problems in Search technology is finding suitable representations for long objects. In this sense, \"long\" is used to describe text documents that significantly exceed the 512 token input limit on Deep Transformer Neural Networks. This problem is a large part of what motivates our interest in Hybrid Search techniques that combine the flexibility of Vector Search with the sparse BM25 word counting algorithm well suited for >512 token text sequences. We think Ref2Vec can also help address this challenge. To be clear, Weaviate already offers a solution to represent long documents with Cross-References! As an example, [the Wikipedia Demo](https://github.com/weaviate/semantic-search-through-wikipedia-with-weaviate) breaks the long Wikipedia articles into a (Paragraph, inArticle, Article) data schema in which each Paragraph contains less than 512 tokens of text.»\n",
      "[2] «We can then vectorize this text description using off-the-shelf models from OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and others to unlock semantic search. We recently presented an example of this idea for [AirBnB listings](https://weaviate.io/blog/generative-feedback-loops-with-llms), translating tabular data about each property’s price, neighborhood, and more into a text description.

For example, if we have a list of items, it might not be best practice to separate the list into 2 chunks because the first half fell into the tail end of a chunk[:512] loop.»\n",
      "[3] «This topic is heavily related to our perspectives on continual optimization of Deep Learning models, discussed further in “Orchestrating Tuning”. Chunking your data is an important step before inserting your data into Weaviate. Chunking takes long documents and converts it into smaller sections. This enhances the retrieval since each chunk has an important nugget of information and this helps to stay within the LLMs token limit. There are quite a few strategies to parse documents.»\n",

In the past, we conducted experiments with AVX-512 to assess its performance potential. However, the results didn’t show a significant increase in performance, particularly on older Intel processors. This lack of notable improvement could be due to thermal and power constraints in these older processor architectures. Such constraints could lead to [reductions in CPU frequency](https://lemire.me/blog/2018/09/07/avx-512-when-and-how-to-use-these-new-instructions/), limiting the capacity of AVX-512 instructions to deliver enhanced performance under these conditions.»\n",

While this system is very safe, the recovery could be slow for several reasons:\n",

If there are multiple places that require recovery, they can each recover independently, without one recovery having to wait for the other. - A mechanism was added that flushes any memtable that has been idle (no writes) for 60s or more. In addition to speeding up the recovery, this change also ensures that no recovery is needed at all in many cases.»\n",

Deduplication of large WALs: By adding a deduplication process, redundant data in the WALs is removed, reducing the recovery time. 2. Parallel recovery: The recovery process now runs in parallel, allowing multiple places requiring recovery to work independently and simultaneously, improving the speed. 3. Idle memtable flushing: Any memtable idle for 60 seconds or more is flushed, reducing the amount of data that needs to be recovered and ensuring faster recovery.

      "\n",
      "Answer: Vector compression and decompression can introduce distortion to the original vectors, and this distortion can affect the accuracy of distance calculations. The compression function $C$ applied to the original vectors $x$ and $y$ results in a shorter representation, but when these compressed vectors are decompressed back into the original space using $C'$, there is a slight difference in the reconstructed vectors $x''$ and $y''$. This distortion, denoted as $\\delta$, adds to the original distance calculation, so the new distance between $x$ and $y$ is given by $d(x, y) = d(x'', y'') + \\delta$. The impact of this distortion on the accuracy of distance calculations depends on the specific compression and decompression functions used and the similarity measure employed to calculate vector distances. In the context of Weaviate, the compression rate of 1:32 for floating-point vectors to `float32` arrays is mentioned, and it is stated that this compression allows for faster computation through bitwise operations. However, the specific impact on accuracy is not explicitly mentioned and would depend on the chosen similarity measure and the characteristics of the data being compressed. In general, vector compression techniques aim to find a balance between reducing storage requirements and maintaining the accuracy of vector operations. The choice of compression algorithm and the acceptable level of distortion depend on the specific use case and the sensitivity of the application to errors in vector calculations.\n",

Go has automatic memory management, which means the Go runtime handles memory allocation and deallocation. Memory allocations can happen on the stack or the heap. The heap is a dynamic memory allocation area, and the stack is a static memory allocation area with a fixed size. When objects are allocated on the heap, the Go runtime keeps track of these allocations and their sizes. The Garbage Collector is then responsible for deallocating unused memory on the heap. However, the GC runs periodically, and if there are a large number of allocations happening in a short period, it can lead to a situation where the available memory is fragmented and not contiguous, even if the total memory available seems sufficient. Additionally, as mentioned in the context, the Go runtime may sometimes allocate more memory than what is apparently necessary. For example, in context [4], it is mentioned that an array of 51 elements was allocated as an array of 100 elements. This can further contribute to the issue of fragmented memory and unexpected out-of-memory (OOM) errors. Reasoning: Let's understand this step by step to provide a comprehensive answer.\n",

      "Answer: Weaviate, a powerful vector search engine, integrates with Cohere's AI Platform to enhance its capabilities. Here's how Weaviate processes and vectorizes queries using Cohere: 1. **Query Receipt**: When a query is received by Weaviate, it recognizes the need to vectorize the query text. 2. **Communication with Cohere**: Weaviate sends the query to Cohere's AI Platform for vectorization. This communication is automated, thanks to the text2vec-cohere module, a collaboration between Weaviate and Cohere. 3. **Vectorization by Cohere**: Cohere's large language models, such as the `command-nightly` model, perform complex natural language processing on the query. This includes understanding the query intent, generating chain-of-thought responses, and producing output vectors that represent the query's semantic meaning. 4. **Query Execution**: Once the query is vectorized by Cohere, Weaviate uses this vector to search for relevant data objects in its database. It compares the query vector with the vectors of stored data objects to find the most similar matches. 5. **Result Retrieval**: Weaviate retrieves the data objects with vectors closest to the query vector and returns them as the query results. This ensures that the results are contextually relevant to the user's query. By leveraging Cohere's advanced language models, Weaviate can process and understand queries more effectively, enabling it to provide accurate and semantically meaningful search results. This integration enhances Weaviate's capabilities in handling complex NLP queries and improves the overall user experience.\n",

So together, the Metadata ranker takes as input something like: [Age, Gender, Location, Occupation, Preferences, Release year, Genre, Box Office, Duration] and predicts a score of how much this User will like the movie. We can fix the User features and rotate in each Document to get a score for each of the candidate movies (retrieved with something like ref2vec) to rank with.

This is also closely related to another category of ranking methods that use models like XGBoost to combine features, as well as say the bm25 score, vector distance, and maybe even the cross encoder score as well. This is a pretty interesting technique when you additionally factor in multiple properties. For example, we could have a bm25, vector, and cross encoders for the `title`, as well as `content` properties and use a learned model to combine these into a final ranking score. I recently came across a paper titled “Injecting the BM25 Score as Text Improves BERT-Based Re-rankers” published in ECIR 2023.»\n",

This required a significant amount of user data to achieve, which zero-shot generalization may stand to disrupt. Cross encoders have gained popularity by taking as input a `(query, document)` pair and outputting a high precision relevance score.

We know that there are a vast number of Sentence Transformer models available from Hugging Face, and that the Weaviate module provides access to these models for semantic search. The context provides some guidelines on how to choose the right model. Firstly, it is important to understand the differences in the models. The models can vary based on architectural decisions, the datasets they were trained on, and the language of the dataset. The specific domain the model is intended for is also a critical factor. For example, a model trained on French sentences will perform better for French sentence embeddings than a model trained on English sentences. The Hugging Face model cards provide color-coded details about each model, including the dataset, language, and additional information. These details can be used to select a model that aligns with the specific requirements of the semantic search use case.\n",

      "Answer: To choose the right Sentence Transformer model from Hugging Face for Semantic Search, consider the following factors: - Language: Select a model that has been trained on a dataset in the same language as your semantic search use case. - Domain: Choose a model that is tailored to the specific domain of your data, such as legal, financial, biomedical, or general text. - Dataset: Review the Hugging Face model cards to understand the datasets the models were trained on and select one that aligns with your data. - Architectural differences: While not discussed in detail in the context, architectural decisions can also impact the performance of the model. Consider the specific architecture of each model and how it aligns with your requirements. By considering these factors and utilizing the information provided in the Hugging Face model cards, you can select the most suitable Sentence Transformer model for your semantic search application.\n",

This required a significant amount of user data to achieve, which zero-shot generalization may stand to disrupt. Cross encoders have gained popularity by taking as input a `(query, document)` pair and outputting a high precision relevance score. This can be easily generalized to recommendation as well, in which the ranker takes as input a `(user description, item description)` pair.»\n",

However, we currently don’t have any official support/policy for non-English languages, which leads to some limitations. This limitation mainly affects [Weaviate’s keyword-based search functionality BM25](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/bm25), as we currently only have the standard English tokenizer.

It helps determine the uniqueness or rarity of a keyword within a collection of texts. By considering the frequency of a term in the entire corpus, the model assesses how informative or distinctive that term is. This information is then used to weigh the importance of the term in the overall scoring calculation, with rarer terms typically receiving higher scores.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «Scalability: Most vector libraries cannot be queried while importing your data, which can be a scalability concern for applications that require importing millions or even billions of objects. Thus, vector libraries are a great solution for applications with a limited static snapshot of data. However, if your application requires real-time scalable semantic search at the production level, you should consider using a vector database. ## Summary\\n\\nThis article explained that vector databases are a type of database that indexes, stores, and provides access to structured or unstructured data alongside its vector embeddings. Vector databases like [Weaviate](http://weaviate.io) allow for efficient similarity search and retrieval of data based on their vector distance or vector similarity at scale.»\\n[2] «Vector Indexing Library\\n\\nSimilarly to vector databases, [vector libraries](https://weaviate.io/blog/vector-library-vs-vector-database) also enable fast vector search.

Updatability: The index data is immutable, and thus, no real-time updates are possible. 2.»\\n[3] «This is why we have **Vector Databases** and **Vector Libraries**. They both use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithm to search through vectors in a tiny fraction of the time. You can learn more about this topic from [\"Why Vectors Search is so Fast.\"](/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast)\\n\\n## The Big Question\\nSo, if both vector databases and vector libraries allow you to efficiently search through your vectors. What are the key differences between them, and why/when should you choose one over the other? ## Vector Libraries\\nVector libraries store vector embeddings in in-memory indexes, in order to perform similarity search.»\\n[4] «Further reading [Why Is Vector Search So Fast?](https://weaviate.io/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast)\\n\\n## Use Cases of Vector Databases\\n\\nVector databases’ search capabilities can be used in various applications ranging from classical Machine Learning use cases, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender systems, to providing long-term memory to LLMs in modern applications. The **most popular use case of vector search engines is naturally for search**. Because a vector database can help find similar objects, it is predestined for applications where you might want to find similar products, movies, books, songs, etc. That’s why vector search engines are also **used in recommendation systems** as a restated task of search. With the rise of LLMs, **vector databases have already been used to enhance modern Generative AI applications**.»\\n[5] «Depending on the data type, vector embeddings are created using machine learning models that are able to translate the meaning of an object into a numerical representation in a high dimensional space. Thus, there are a variety of machine learning models able to create a variety of different types of embeddings, such as word embeddings, sentence embeddings, text embeddings, or image embeddings. Vector embeddings capture the semantic relationship between data objects in numerical values and thus, you can find similar data points by determining their nearest neighbors in the high dimensional vector space. This concept is also called similarity search and can be applied in different applications, such as text search, image search, or recommendation systems. Now that you have a good understanding of vector embeddings, you might also be interested in the following articles:\\n* [What is a vector database?](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database)\\n* [Distance metrics for nearest neighbor search](https://weaviate.io/blog/distance-metrics-in-vector-search)\\n* [Why is vector search so fast?](https://weaviate.io/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast)\\n\\nimport WhatNext from \\'/_includes/what-next.mdx\\'\\n\\n<WhatNext />»\\n\\nQuestion: Why might vector libraries not be suitable for applications that require real-time updates and scalable semantic search?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: Let\\'s break down the question and identify the key points to address. First, we need to understand the capabilities and limitations of vector libraries. Then, we can assess why they may not be suitable for certain use cases. Vector libraries are designed to store vector embeddings of data objects, and they do so in in-memory indexes. This provides fast vector search capabilities. However, there are two main limitations to consider: 1. **Scalability**: Vector libraries cannot be queried while importing data. This becomes a bottleneck for applications that deal with large amounts of data, especially in the billions of objects. The library has to finish importing all the data before any queries can be made, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. 2. **Updatability**: The vector library indexes are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. This results in an inability to perform real-time updates. Any changes to the data would require recreating the entire index, which is impractical for applications that require dynamic data updates.\\n\\nAnswer: Vector libraries may not be suitable for applications that require real-time updates and scalable semantic search due to their limitations in updatability and scalability. The immutable nature of vector library indexes prevents real-time updates, and the lack of query capabilities during data import affects their scalability for large datasets. Therefore, applications that demand dynamic data changes and efficient handling of vast amounts of data would be better served by alternative solutions, such as vector databases.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «I recommend checking out the GitHub repository to test this out yourself!\\n\\n## Additional Resources\\n• [LangChain Guide](https://www.commandbar.com/blog/langchain-projects) by Paul from CommandBar. import WhatsNext from \\'/_includes/what-next.mdx\\';\\n\\n<WhatsNext />»\\n[2] «We will review and help you out in the process. 💚\\n\\nYou can also contribute by adding your own Weaviate examples.

Given this information, we can create a query that asks about the purpose of combining LangChain with Weaviate, as this is a specific topic that the document addresses. Query: What are the benefits of combining LangChain with Weaviate in the context of LLMs? ```\\n</details>\\n\\n#### Grab Data out of Weaviate\\n\\nNow that we have the synthetic query + relevant chunk, we can export the data to fine-tune the model. We’ll grab 80% of the objects for training and 20% for validation.»\\n[4] «In this example we used two research papers; however, there is the possibility to add Powerpoint presentations or even scanned letters to your Weaviate instance. Unstructured has really simplified the process of using visual document parsing for diverse document types. We tested a few queries above, but we can take this one step further by using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/weaviate). Once the documents are imported into Weaviate, you can build a simple chatbot to chat with your pdfs by using LangChain’s vectorstore. ```python\\nfrom langchain.vectorstores.weaviate import Weaviate\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\nfrom langchain.chains import ChatVectorDBChain\\nimport weaviate\\n\\nclient = weaviate.Client(\"http://localhost:8080\")\\n\\nvectorstore = Weaviate(client, \"NAME_OF_CLASS\", \"NAME_OF_PROPERTY\")\\n\\nMyOpenAI = OpenAI(temperature=0.2,\\n    openai_api_key=\"ENTER YOUR OPENAI KEY HERE\")\\n\\nqa = ChatVectorDBChain.from_llm(MyOpenAI, vectorstore)\\n\\nchat_history = []\\n\\nwhile True:\\n    query = input(\"\")\\n    result = qa({\"question\": query, \"chat_history\": chat_history})\\n    print(result[\"answer\"])\\n    chat_history = [(query, result[\"answer\"])]\\n```\\n\\nimport WhatNext from \\'/_includes/what-next.mdx\\'\\n\\n<WhatNext />»\\n[5] «We ...

For Gist we would require roughly 4218 MB to 5103 MB of memory to index our data using uncompressed HNSW. This version would give us recall ranging from 0.7446 to 0.9962 and latencies ranging from 2133 to 15539 microseconds.»\\n[3] «Furthermore, you might be using Weaviate with your own data which might be even bigger than the datasets we report on below.

To close the results up, we have also indexed the full Sphere dataset (nearly 1 billion vectors) with and without compression. The full dataset without compression needed nearly **2.7 Terabytes** of memory while the compressed version only required **0.7 Terabytes** which is again, a huge saving in terms of memory and costs. ## 📈Benchmarking PQ with your own data\\n\\nIf you\\'re trying to finetune HNSW and PQ parameters on your own data to optimally balance recall, latency, and memory footprint you might want to replicate these experiments yourself.»\\n[5] «The main metric of concern in this setting is the latency with which we can obtain our replies.

When using uncompressed HNSW, the memory requirement ranges from 4218 MB to 5103 MB depending on the parameters. After compression, the memory requirement for Gist Low params is 1572 MB. Question: What is the percentage reduction in memory requirements for the Gist dataset with low parameters after compression? Reasoning: To find the percentage reduction in memory requirements, we can use the following formula: % reduction = ((initial value - final value) / initial value) * 100% We know that the initial memory requirement for Gist Low params is 4218 MB, and the final memory requirement after compression is 1572 MB. % reduction = ((4218 MB - 1572 MB) / 4218 MB) * 100% = 62.72% reduction\\n\\nAnswer: There is a 62.72% reduction in memory requirements for the Gist dataset with low parameters after compression.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «### Testing queries\\n\\nSemantic (`nearText`) searches may be one of the most common (if not *the* most common) searches our users perform.

You can even [bring your own vectors](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors), for example if you already have a vectorization pipeline available, or if none of the publicly available models are suitable for you. For one, Weaviate supports using any Hugging Face models through our `text2vec-hugginface` module, so that you can [choose one of the many sentence transformers published on Hugging Face](/blog/how-to-choose-a-sentence-transformer-from-hugging-face). Or, you can use other very popular vectorization APIs such as OpenAI or Cohere through the [`text2vec-openai`](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai) or [`text2vec-cohere`](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere) modules.»\\n\\nQuestion: How do you test semantic search functionality and result consistency using `text2vec-openai`?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Answer: Here is the response formatted as requested: Context: The text describes the process of setting up and testing a Weaviate database with a focus on semantic search functionality using the `text2vec-openai` module. It includes code snippets and explanations for various steps, such as defining the database schema, running queries, and implementing endpoints for a retrieval plugin. Question: How do you test semantic search functionality and result consistency using `text2vec-openai`? Reasoning: To test the semantic search functionality and result consistency using `text2vec-openai`, we need to follow the steps outlined in the context. First, we define the database schema, including the fields that will be vectorized, such as \"ingredients,\" \"description,\" and \"effects.\" Then, we can run queries using the `nearText` search parameter to perform semantic searches. In the example given, the query searches for \"chemistry\" and expects the top result to be about \"sodium.\" We can also specify the distance parameter to control the relevance of the results. To test the consistency of the results, we can use assertions in our test code. In the provided code snippet, the `test_query` function asserts that the length of the results is equal to the specified limit and that the query term (\"lion\" in this case) is present in the text of each result. By running this test for different queries and comparing the results, we can evaluate the consistency of the semantic search functionality.\\n\\nAnswer: To test semantic search functionality and result consistency using `text2vec-openai`, we define the database schema, including fields for vectorization. We run queries using `nearText` and specify distance parameters. We can test consistency by asserting expected results and comparing outcomes for different queries.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «We recommend to use a Docker Compose setup for trying out or evaluating Weaviate and when developing with Weaviate locally. However, for a stable production environment, we [recommend to run Weaviate on Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes).

What was a mere experiment back then is a regular production case today. But earlier this year, we saw a shift in usage patterns: As we onboarded more and more large-scale and enterprise users, the definition of scale shifted from the number of vectors to the number of individual tenants that can run on a single setup. Previously, Weaviate offered multiple ways to tackle multi-tenancy, but none were intended for a massive scale.»\\n[4] «For sure it might not be for everybody and every use case.

It recommends Docker Compose for trying out and evaluating Weaviate locally, while suggesting Weaviate on Kubernetes for a stable production environment. The text also highlights the benefits of using Weaviate at scale, including the ability to handle ever-growing datasets and complex queries with strict latency requirements. Additionally, it introduces the native multi-tenancy feature, which allows for a massive number of individual tenants on a single setup.\\n\\nAnswer: The document recommends that users running Weaviate at scale in production consider enabling the native multi-tenancy feature. This feature addresses the shift in usage patterns towards a larger number of individual tenants, providing a solution for massive-scale multi-tenancy.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «Document understanding techniques use an encoder-decoder pipeline that leverages the power of both computer vision and natural language processing methods.

This is a widely-accepted estimate, and a good indicator of the prevalence of unstructured data. Understanding and processing this unstructured data is a challenge, and this is where Weaviate comes in. Weaviate is an AI-first vector database that helps unlock the potential of unstructured data. It does this by using AI-driven indexing and search technologies, enabling real-time text processing and automatic classification of texts. With Weaviate, users can search using fuzzy terms and classify rich data like free text, PDFs, and more.\\n\\nAnswer: Approximately 80% of all data is unstructured.

This is a very common and powerful way to build Home Feed style features in apps.»\\n\\nQuestion: What is Ref2Vec, and how does it integrate with Weaviate to provide real-time user-based recommendations?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to understand what Ref2Vec is and how it works with Weaviate to deliver real-time recommendations based on user behavior.\\n\\nAnswer: Ref2Vec, or reference-to-vector, is a technique that enables the vectorization of a data object by leveraging its cross-references to other objects. In simple terms, it calculates vectors that represent a user\\'s interactions with different items or classes. This is achieved by aggregating the representations of the referenced objects to create a vector for the referencing object. In the given context, Ref2Vec is used to capture a user\\'s preferences and actions on an e-commerce platform. Now, how does Ref2Vec integrate with Weaviate to provide real-time user-based recommendations? Weaviate is a vector database and search engine that can power high-quality, fast recommendations. Ref2Vec enhances Weaviate\\'s capabilities by allowing it to learn from user behavior and preferences in real time. When a user interacts with multiple items on an e-commerce platform (for example, clicking on shoe images), Ref2Vec calculates a vector that represents the user\\'s interest in that particular category or style. This vector is created by aggregating the vectors of the referenced products (the shoes the user clicked on). By integrating Ref2Vec with Weaviate, the system can dynamically update user vectors based on their interactions and preferences. This enables Weaviate to provide relevant and personalized recommendations in real time. For instance, if a user has purchased or shown interest in boots, shorts, and a Weaviate t-shirt, Ref2Vec can aggregate these product representations to characterize the user\\'s overall style preferences. As a result, Weaviate can offer recommendations that align closely with the user\\'s tastes, improving their shopping experience. In summary, Ref2Vec enables the vectorization of user preferences by aggregating their interactions with various items. This information is then used by Weaviate to update user vectors in real time, leading to more accurate and personalized recommendations. The combination of Ref2Vec and Weaviate thus enhances the user experience by delivering relevant and timely suggestions based on their behavior and interests.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «We have three documents labeled `A`, `B`, and `C` and have run a BM25 and Dense search. In this example, we have set the constant *k* to 0. | BM25 Ranking | Dense Ranking | Results\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| A | B | A: 1/1 + 1/3 = 1.3 |\\n| B | C | B: 1/2 + 1/1 = 1.5 |\\n| C | A | C: 1/3 + 1/2 = 0.83|\\n\\nThe above table shows the ranked order of the BM25 and Dense search. To fuse the two lists together, we need to take the sum of the reciprocal ranks. Based on the results, the top document is `Document B` with a ranking of 1.5, then `Document A` at 1.3, and `Document C` at 0.83.»\\n[2] «The dense vector representation is able to disambiguate “catch” as meaning fishing rather than baseball or sickness. The sparse vector search will match the phrase “Alaskan Pollock” only. This example query shows where hybrid search combines the best of both sparse and dense vectors. ## Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)\\n\\nWhile researching hybrid search, we needed a way to combine the results of BM25 and dense vector search into a single ranked list. We came across a paper from Benham and Culpepper exploring rank fusion techniques.»\\n[3] «Note, the current implementation of hybrid search in Weaviate uses BM25/BM25F and vector search. If you’re interested to learn about how dense vector indexes are built and optimized in Weaviate, check out this [article](/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast). ### BM25\\nBM25 builds on the keyword scoring method [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) (Term-Frequency Inverse-Document Frequency) by taking the [Binary Independence Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Independence_Model) from the IDF calculation and adding a normalization penalty that weighs a document’s length relative to the average length of all the documents in the database. The image below presents the scoring calculation of BM25:\\n![BM25 calculation](./img/BM25-calculation.png) <div align=\"center\"><i>Source: Wikipedia page on Okapi BM25</i></div>\\n\\nThe score of the document, query pair is determined by weighing the uniqueness of each keyword in the query relative to the collection of texts. BM25 contains additional static parameters, k1 and b that may help calibrate performance to particular datasets.»\\n[4] «In this blog post, you will learn about the implementation of hybrid search in Weaviate and how to use it. ## Sparse and Dense Vectors\\nSparse and dense vectors are calculated with distinct algorithms. Sparse vectors have mostly zero values with only a few non-zero values, while dense vectors mostly contain non-zero values. Sparse embeddings are generated from algorithms like [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) and [SPLADE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05720). Dense embeddings are generated from machine learning models like\\n[GloVe](https://text2vec.org/glove.html) and [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).»\\n[5] «And that Weaviate recently added a new algorithm for how this is done? In this post, we’ll dive into exactly the world of hybrid search to discuss how it works, how results are produced, the algorithms used, and more. So let’s get into it!\\n\\n:::info\\n- Vector search and keyword search are also known as dense vector search and sparse vector search respectively. - Keyword search is also called a BM25 search in Weaviate, as it is based on the [BM25F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) scoring algorithm. :::\\n\\n## How does hybrid search work, exactly?»\\n\\nQuestion: How are BM25 and Dense search rankings combined using reciprocal ranks, and what is the resulting order of documents A, B, and C?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: The context provides a table with the BM25 and Dense search rankings for documents A, B, and C, along with their respective reciprocal ranks. To combine the rankings and determine the final order, we need to calculate the sum of the reciprocal ranks for each document.\\n\\nAnswer: The BM25 and Dense search rankings are combined by calculating the reciprocal rank for each document in both lists and then summing them up. The resulting order of documents A, B, and C is: 1. Document B (sum of reciprocal ranks: 1/2 + 1/1 = 1.5) 2. Document A (sum of reciprocal ranks: 1/1 + 1/3 = 1.33) 3. Document C (sum of reciprocal ranks: 1/3 + 1/2 = 0.83) So, the final ranking is B > A > C.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «So syntax that is currently like this:\\n\\n:::note Classic client syntax\\n```python\\nresponse[\\'data\\'][\\'Get\\'][\\'Article\\'][0][\\'title\\']  # Get the `title` property of the first object\\nresponse[\\'data\\'][\\'Get\\'][\\'Article\\'][0][\\'_additional\\'][\\'id\\']  # Get the ID of the first object\\nresponse[\\'data\\'][\\'Get\\'][\\'Article\\'][0][\\'_additional\\'][\\'generate\\'][\\'singleResult\\']  # Get the generated text from a `singlePrompt` request\\nresponse[\\'data\\'][\\'Get\\'][\\'Article\\'][0][\\'_additional\\'][\\'generate\\'][\\'groupedResult\\']  # Get the generated text from a `groupedTask` request\\n```\\n\\n:::\\n\\nBecome:\\n\\n:::info `Collections` client syntax\\n\\n```python\\nresponse.objects[0].properties[\\'title\\']  # Get the `title` property of the first object\\nresponse.objects[0].uuid  # Get the ID of the first object\\nresponse.objects[0].generated  # Get the generated text from a `singlePrompt` request\\nresponse.generated  # Get the generated text from a `groupedTask` request\\n```\\n\\n:::\\n\\nWe think that these changes will reduce errors, increase productivity, and make the code easier to read and understand. ### Collections-first approach\\n\\nThe other big change is that the `collections` client focuses on individual collections for interaction.

By examining the context, we can determine the specific differences in syntax between the two clients.\\n\\nAnswer: The syntax differences between the classic client and the collections client for accessing data object properties are as follows: Classic Client: - Uses a chain of methods with the `with_` prefix, such as `with_limit` and `with_generate`, to specify query parameters. - Requires specifying the collection name in every request. - Uses a builder pattern for queries. - Requires using the `?` operator for optional chaining and the `[\\'_additional\\']` index due to the underscore in the key name. - Accesses properties using bracket notation, such as `response[\\'data\\'][\\'Get\\'][\\'Article\\'][0][\\'title\\']`. Collections Client: - Uses standalone methods with parameters, such as `fetch_objects` and `generate.near_text`, to perform queries. - Does not require specifying the collection name in every request. Instead, a collection object is created and used for subsequent requests. - Simplifies the syntax by removing the need for the `?` operator and the `[\\'_additional\\']` index. - Accesses properties using dot notation, such as `response.objects[0].properties[\\'title\\']`. - Introduces types for data objects, allowing direct access to their properties. - Returns most properties and metadata by default, including object IDs, creation times, and vector search distances. The collections client aims to improve readability, reduce errors, and increase productivity by simplifying the syntax and introducing standalone methods. It also eliminates the need to specify the collection name in every request, streamlining the code.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «It significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks. 2.

Once the diffusion model is trained in this way it becomes an expert at taking images that are less likely to be seen in the dataset (noisy images) and incrementally turning them into something that is more likely to be seen in the training set.

Animation](./img/rag_flow.gif)\\n\\n## What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)? Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced method to enhance traditional search techniques by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to help identify and summarize answers. Instead of having to manually comb through documents to find an answer, a RAG system allows you to retrieve relevant sources and return a response in natural, conversational language.»\\n\\nQuestion: What is Retrieval Augmented Generation and what are its common applications?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: Let\\'s break down the context to understand Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and its common applications. First, the context mentions that RAG is a technique used in search engines and information retrieval systems. It is described as an advanced method that enhances traditional search techniques by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM). The main idea behind RAG is to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results by combining information retrieval techniques with the power of LLMs. By using an LLM, RAG systems can identify and summarize answers from relevant sources, providing users with more concise and personalized responses. Now, let\\'s identify the common applications of RAG: - **Search Engines**: RAG is particularly useful for search engines, where the goal is to provide users with the most relevant and accurate results for their queries. By incorporating RAG techniques, search engines can offer more personalized and contextually relevant answers, enhancing the user experience. - **Question Answering Systems**: RAG is ideal for question-answering systems, where the goal is to provide direct answers to user queries. By retrieving relevant sources and using LLMs to generate responses, RAG systems can offer more accurate and contextually rich answers. - **Information Retrieval Applications**: Any application that involves retrieving information from a large corpus of data can benefit from RAG. This includes document retrieval systems, knowledge bases, and content recommendation engines. RAG enables these applications to provide more targeted and relevant results to users. - **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks**: RAG can be applied to various NLP tasks beyond just question answering. It can be used for text summarization, information extraction, sentiment analysis, and language understanding tasks, where the ability to retrieve relevant context is crucial.\\n\\nAnswer: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique used in search engines and information retrieval systems. It enhances traditional search techniques by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify and summarize relevant answers. RAG is particularly useful for search engines, question-answering systems, information retrieval applications, and various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, providing more accurate, personalized, and contextually relevant responses to users.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «More importantly, every tenant has a dedicated high-performance vector index providing query speeds as if the tenant was the only user on your cluster. With more features in the pipeline, such as tenant-specific rate limiting or tenant-specific replication factors, you can customize performance per tenant even further. ### GDPR-compliant and efficient deletes\\nWhen discussing solutions made for many users, our first intuition is to worry about how we onboard and serve them. But deleting them is equally important – both for technical and legal reasons. Take GDPR as an example.»\\n[2] «You can easily run with 50,000+ active shards per node. With just 20 nodes, you can support 1M concurrently active tenants. And with support for inactive tenants (coming soon - read below), there is no limit per node at all. ### Fast and efficient querying\\nYou don’t need to set a filter to restrict a query to a tenant. The simple addition of a tenant key is enough, and Weaviate will find the right tenant’s shard for you.»\\n[3] «From a performance perspective, you would build a giant monolithic vector index with potentially billions of vectors, yet you would only ever query a tiny fraction of it. With a median tenant storing between 1,000 and 100,000 objects, you would typically query less than 0.01% of the index. What a waste of resources. Additionally, dropping many tenants simultaneously would lead to expensive repair operations on the shared index. Resource isolation for tenants was also not possible.»\\n[4] «### Multi Tenancy\\n\\n[Multi tenancy](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/multi-tenancy) isolates data in individual tenants to avoid cross querying of search results. Each tenant is a separate shard in Weaviate, giving you high guarantees of isolation between data. This feature is ideal if you have different customers where each wants to load data into your enterprise application, but don’t want cross pollination of results between those tenants. The Weaviate multi tenancy scales to millions of tenants. If you’d like to learn more about our multi tenancy implementation, [read this blog post](https://weaviate.io/blog/multi-tenancy-vector-search) by our CTO, Etienne Dilocker.»\\n[5] «With Weaviate’s rebalancing features (coming soon), you can ensure tenants are distributed across nodes exactly how you want them to – or leave it to Weaviate to do it for you. ### Active and inactive tenants\\nWith traditional search and other vector search solutions, infrastructure is typically sized for the number of objects or vectors that could be served. But why should you pay for expensive compute and memory resources for users who aren’t currently active? Enabled by Weaviate’s strict isolation between tenants, Weaviate allows you to distinguish between active and inactive tenants. A user hasn’t been logged in for an hour?»\\n\\nQuestion: How does the system ensure fast query speeds for individual tenants and what upcoming features will allow further customization of tenant performance?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to focus on the parts of the context that discuss query speeds and tenant performance. We can then identify the current mechanisms in place and the future features that will enhance them.\\n\\nAnswer: The system ensures fast query speeds for individual tenants by providing each tenant with a dedicated high-performance vector index. This isolation means that queries are restricted to a specific tenant\\'s shard, allowing for quick and efficient retrieval of data. Upcoming features that will allow further customization of tenant performance include tenant-specific rate limiting and tenant-specific replication factors. These features will provide finer-grained control over how tenants utilize resources and interact with the system, ultimately resulting in even faster query speeds and improved performance for individual tenants.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «The below `curl` command will back up all classes in **W1**, and call the backup `my-very-first-backup`. ```bash\\ncurl \\\\\\n-X POST \\\\\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n-d \\'{\\n     \"id\": \"my-very-first-backup\"\\n    }\\' \\\\\\nhttp://localhost:8080/v1/backups/filesystem\\n```\\n\\n:::note The `backup_id` must be unique. The ID value is used to create a subdirectory in the backup location, and attempting to reuse an existing ID will cause Weaviate to throw an error. Delete the existing directory if one already exists. :::\\n\\nNow try running `3_backup` yourself to back up data from **W1**.»\\n[2] «```bash\\nscripts/3_backup.sh\\n```\\n\\nIf you check the contents of the backup directory again, you should see a new directory called `my-very-first-backup` containing the backup data files. Restoring this data can be done with a similarly short piece of code. The `curl` command below will restore our backup:\\n```bash\\ncurl \\\\\\n-X POST \\\\\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n-d \\'{\\n     \"id\": \"my-very-first-backup\"\\n    }\\' \\\\\\nhttp://localhost:8090/v1/backups/filesystem/my-very-first-backup/restore\\n```\\n\\nTry running `4_restore` yourself to restore the **W1** backup data to **W2**. ```bash\\nscripts/4_restore.sh\\n```\\n\\nNow, check the schemas again for **W1** and **W2**. ```bash\\nscripts/0_query_instances.sh\\n```\\n\\nDo they *both* now contain the same schema?»\\n[3] «For example, the below `curl` command will restore only the `Author` class regardless of whether any other classes have been also included in `my-very-first-backup`. ```bash\\ncurl \\\\\\n-X POST \\\\\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n-d \\'{\\n     \"id\": \"my-very-first-backup\",\\n     \"include\": [\"Author\"]\\n    }\\' \\\\\\nhttp://localhost:8090/v1/backups/filesystem/my-very-first-backup/restore\\n```\\n\\nDelete everything in **W2** first with `8_delete_w2`, and try out the partial restore with `4a_partial_restore`. ```bash\\nscripts/8_delete_w2.sh\\nscripts/4a_partial_restore.sh\\n```\\n\\nYou should see that **W2** will only contain one class even though its data was restored from a backup that contains multiple classes. The restore function allows you to restore a class as long as the target Weaviate instance does not already contain that class. So if you run another operation to restore the `Book` class to **W2**, it will result in an instance containing both `Author` and `Book` classes.»\\n[4] «For example, you can create a backup called **first_backup** and push it to **GCS**, like this:\\n\\n```js\\nPOST /v1/backups/gcs/\\n{\\n  \"id\": \"first_backup\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen, you can check the backup status by calling:\\n\\n```js\\nGET /v1/backups/gcs/first_backup\\n```\\n\\n### Restore\\nTo restore a backup, you can call:\\n\\n```js\\nPOST /v1/backups/{store}/{backup_id}/restore\\n```\\n\\nSo, using our previous example, you can restore the **first_backup**, like this:\\n\\n```js\\nPOST /v1/backups/gcs/first_backup/restore\\n```\\n\\nYou can also, check the status of an ongoing restoration by calling:\\n\\n```js\\nGET /v1/backups/gcs/first_backup/restore\\n```\\n\\n### Cross-cloud\\nHere is one interesting thing that you might not have noticed. You can use this setup to run Weaviate with one cloud provider but then store and restore backups to/from another cloud provider. So, for example, you can run Weaviate on AWS and use GCS for your backup needs. How cool is that? ### Class backups\\nYou can also create backups for specific classes or select which classes you want to restore.»\\n[5] «### Asynchronous operations\\nIn some cases, Weaviate\\'s response to your `backup` or `restore` request may have  `\"status\":\"STARTED\"`.<br/>\\n*Isn\\'t it interesting that the status was not indicative of a completion?*\\n\\nThat is because Weaviate\\'s backup operation can be initiated and monitored asynchronously. This means that you don\\'t need to maintain a connection to the server for the operation to complete. And you can look in on the status of a restore operation with a command like:\\n```bash\\ncurl http://localhost:8090/v1/backups/filesystem/my-very-first-backup/restore\\n```\\n\\nWeaviate remains available for read and write operations while backup operations are ongoing. And you can poll the endpoint to check its status, without worrying about any potential downtime. Check out `3a_check_backup_status.sh` and `4b_check_restore_status.sh` for examples of how to query **W1** for the backup status, or **W2** for the restore status respectively.»\\n\\nQuestion: How do you create a unique backup called `my-very-first-backup` for classes in W1 using a curl command?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We can refer to the provided context to identify the steps to create a unique backup called \\'my-very-first-backup\\' for classes in W1 using a curl command.\\n\\nAnswer: To create a unique backup called \\'my-very-first-backup\\' for classes in W1, you can use the following curl command: ```bash curl \\\\ -X POST \\\\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\ -d \\'{ \"id\": \"my-very-first-backup\" }\\' \\\\ http://localhost:8080/v1/backups/filesystem ``` This command sends a POST request to the Weaviate instance at \\'http://localhost:8080\\' to create a backup with the unique ID \\'my-very-first-backup\\'. The \\'-X POST\\' option specifies the HTTP method as POST, and the \\'-d\\' option provides the request body, which includes the \\'id\\' field set to the desired backup name. The \\'-H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\\' option sets the content type of the request to JSON. By executing this command, you initiate the process of creating a backup of all classes in W1 with the specified unique name.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «The good news is, there are companies – like Hugging Face, OpenAI, and Cohere – that offer running model inference as a service. > \"Running model inference in production is hard,\\nlet them do it for you.\"\\n\\n## Support for Hugging Face Inference API in Weaviate\\nStarting from Weaviate `v1.15`, Weaviate includes a Hugging Face module, which provides support for Hugging Face Inference straight from the vector database.

We know from the context that Weaviate offers a way to use Hugging Face modules without having to run the Inference API directly. The process is described as straightforward, and we can identify the key steps to follow: - Weaviate includes a Hugging Face module that provides support for Hugging Face Inference. This is available from version 1.15 onwards. - The Hugging Face module delegates the model inference tasks to the Hugging Face Inference service. - To use the module, one needs to set \\'text2vec-huggingface\\' as the default vectorizer in the configuration. - An API token from Hugging Face is also required, which can be obtained from their website. - With these settings in place, Weaviate coordinates the data imports, updates, and queries, communicating with the Hugging Face Inference API on the user\\'s behalf.\\n\\nAnswer: To use Hugging Face modules with Weaviate without running the Inference API yourself, follow these steps: 1. Ensure you are using Weaviate version 1.15 or newer. 2. Set \\'text2vec-huggingface\\' as the default vectorizer in your Weaviate configuration. 3. Obtain a Hugging Face API token from the Hugging Face website. 4. Provide your API token when setting up the Hugging Face module in Weaviate. 5. With these settings, Weaviate will handle the communication with the Hugging Face Inference API, allowing you to focus on your application\\'s requirements.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «---\\ntitle: Better automated testing with Embedded Weaviate\\nslug: automated-testing\\nauthors: [dan]\\ndate: 2023-07-18\\nimage: ./img/hero.png\\ntags: [\\'how-to\\']\\ndescription: \"Learn how to make testing less of a chore with Embedded Weaviate, and other tips for better automated testing.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\nimport Tabs from \\'@theme/Tabs\\';\\nimport TabItem from \\'@theme/TabItem\\';\\nimport FilteredTextBlock from \\'@site/src/components/Documentation/FilteredTextBlock\\';\\nimport PyCode from \\'!!raw-loader!/_includes/code/automated-testing.py\\';\\nimport TSCode from \\'!!raw-loader!/_includes/code/automated-testing.ts\\';\\nimport { DownloadButton } from \\'/src/theme/Buttons\\';\\n\\n![Automated testing for Weaviate applications](./img/hero.png)\\n\\nAs a software engineer with experience in test automation, I firmly believe in [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and more specifically, incorporating [integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) from the very early stages of developing an application. <!-- truncate -->\\n\\nBut you probably know that writing tests is quite a task in itself, and in many cases running them can also be a chore.

Like this:\\n\\n```yaml\\nDEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: text2vec-huggingface\\nENABLE_MODULES: text2vec-huggingface\\n```\\n\\n## How to get started\\n\\n:::note\\nThis article is not meant as a hands-on tutorial. For more detailed instructions please check the [documentation](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-huggingface). :::\\n\\nThe overall process to use a Hugging Face module with Weaviate is fairly straightforward. ![Recipe for using the Hugging Face module](./img/how-to-get-started-recipe.png)\\nIf this was a cooking class and you were following a recipe.»\\n[2] «Then, you just run the queries, as per usual:\\n```javascript\\nnearText = {\\n    \"concepts\": [\"How to use Hugging Face modules with Weaviate?\"],\\n    \"distance\": 0.6,\\n}\\n\\nresult = (\\n    client.query\\n    .get(\"Notes\", [\\n        \"name\",\\n        \"comment\",\\n        \"_additional {certainty distance} \"])\\n    .with_near_text(nearText)\\n    .do()\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Summary\\n> Now you can use [Hugging Face](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-huggingface) or [OpenAI](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai) modules in Weaviate to delegate model inference out. Just pick the model, provide your API key and start working with your data. Weaviate optimizes the communication process with the Inference API for you, so that you can focus on the challenges and requirements of your applications. No need to run the Inference API yourself. ## What next\\nCheck out the [text2vec-huggingface](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-huggingface) documentation to learn more about the new module.»\\n[3] «You would need the following ingredients:\\n* Raw Data\\n* Hugging Face API token – which you can request from [their website](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)\\n* A working Weaviate instance with the `text2vec-huggingface` enabled\\n\\nThen you would follow these steps. ### Step 1 – initial preparation – create schema and select the hf models\\nOnce you have a Weaviate instance up and running. Define your schema (standard stuff – pick a class name, select properties, and data types). As a part of the schema definition, you also need to provide, which Hugging Face model you want to use for each schema class. This is done by adding a `moduleConfig` property with the `model` name, to the schema definition, like this:\\n```javascript\\n{\\n    \"class\": \"Notes\",\\n    \"moduleConfig\": {\\n        \"text2vec-huggingface\": {\\n            \"model\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\",  # model name\\n            ...»\\n[4] «The good news is, there are companies – like Hugging Face, OpenAI, and Cohere – that offer running model inference as a service. > \"Running model inference in production is hard,\\nlet them do it for you.\"\\n\\n## Support for Hugging Face Inference API in Weaviate\\nStarting from Weaviate `v1.15`, Weaviate includes a Hugging Face module, which provides support for Hugging Face Inference straight from the vector database. The Hugging Face module, allows you to use the [Hugging Face Inference service](https://huggingface.co/inference-api#pricing) with sentence similarity models, to vectorize and query your data, straight from Weaviate. No need to run the Inference API yourself. > You can choose between `text2vec-huggingface` (Hugging Face) and `text2vec-openai` (OpenAI) modules to delegate your model inference tasks.<br/>\\n> Both modules are enabled by default in the [Weaviate Cloud](/pricing).»\\n[5] «Each `text2vec-*` module uses an external API (like `text2vec-openai` or `text2vec-huggingface`) or a local instance like `text2vec-transformers` to produce a vector for each object. Let\\'s try vectorizing data with the `text2vec-cohere` module. We will be using data from `tiny_jeopardy.csv` [available here](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples/tree/main/text2vec-behind-curtain) containing questions from the game show Jeopardy. We\\'ll just use a few (20) questions here, but the [full dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/200000-jeopardy-questions) includes 200k+ questions. Load the data into a Pandas dataframe, then populate Weaviate like this:\\n\\n```python\\nclient.batch.configure(batch_size=100)  # Configure batch\\nwith client.batch as batch:\\n    for i, row in df.iterrows():\\n        properties = {\\n            \"question\": row.Question,\\n            \"answer\": row.Answer\\n        }\\n        batch.add_data_object(properties, \"Question\")\\n```\\n\\nThis should add a series of `Question` objects with text properties like this:\\n\\n```text\\n{\\'question\\': \\'In 1963, live on \"The Art Linkletter Show\", this company served its billionth burger\\',\\n \\'answer\\': \"McDonald\\'s\"}\\n```\\n\\nSince we use the `text2vec-cohere` module to vectorize our data, we can query Weaviate to find data objects most similar to any input text.»\\n\\nQuestion: How do you set up a Weaviate instance with the `text2vec-huggingface` module?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer. We can refer to the provided context, which outlines the process of setting up the Weaviate instance with the \\'text2vec-huggingface\\' module. Firstly, it is mentioned that to use the Hugging Face module in Weaviate open source, one needs to set \\'text2vec-huggingface\\' as the default vectorizer in the configuration file (usually YAML). This is a crucial step to ensure Weaviate uses the correct module for vectorization. Secondly, the context provides a step-by-step guide, comparing the process to following a recipe in a cooking class. It emphasizes the need for specific \\'ingredients\\', which include raw data, a Hugging Face API token, and a working Weaviate instance with the \\'text2vec-huggingface\\' module enabled. Thirdly, the guide instructs users to define their schema, including class names, properties, and data types. This is a standard procedure when working with structured data in Weaviate. As part of the schema definition, users need to specify which Hugging Face model they want to use for each schema class. This is achieved by adding a \\'moduleConfig\\' property to the schema, where the desired model name is provided. Finally, the context mentions that Weaviate \\'v1.15\\' and newer versions include the Hugging Face module, which provides support for Hugging Face Inference straight from the vector database. This implies that ensuring the Weaviate instance is updated to the latest version is essential for accessing the Hugging Face module. With these steps in mind, we can now formulate a response.\\n\\nAnswer: To set up a Weaviate instance with the \\'text2vec-huggingface\\' module, follow these steps: 1. Ensure you have the necessary ingredients: raw data to work with, a Hugging Face API token (obtainable from their website), and a functioning Weaviate instance. 2. Configure your Weaviate instance by setting \\'text2vec-huggingface\\' as the default vectorizer in the configuration file. 3. Define your schema, including class names, properties, and data types. As part of this step, specify the desired Hugging Face model for each schema class by adding a \\'moduleConfig\\' property to the schema definition. 4. Update your Weaviate instance to the latest version (\\'v1.15\\' or newer) to access the built-in Hugging Face module, which facilitates Hugging Face Inference straight from the vector database. By following these steps, you can effectively set up Weaviate to utilize the \\'text2vec-huggingface\\' module for vectorization and model inference tasks.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «`go_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes` should always be present even with an empty schema. ![datadog summary](./img/datadog-summary.png)\\n\\n\\n## Key Metrics\\n\\nBelow are some key Weaviate metrics to monitor. Standard CPU, Disk, Network metrics are also useful as are [Kubernetes\\nevents](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/01/23/how-to-use-kubernetes-events-for-effective-alerting-and-monitoring/). Note that some Weaviate metrics will not appear until an operation has occurred (for instance batch operations). ### Heap Usage\\n\\nFor heap usage, the expectation is the memory will have a standard jagged pattern underload but that memory will drop periodically\\ndue to the Go garbage collection.»\\n[2] «```\\ngo_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes{job=\"weaviate\"}\\n```\\n### Dashboards\\n\\nOne benefit of this approach is that you can now reuse the existing Weaviate Grafana dashboards. Steps to import these dashboards:\\n\\n1\\\\. Download and import the [preexisting dashboards](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/tree/master/tools/dev/grafana/dashboards). 2\\\\. If you\\'re using Grafana Cloud hosted Prometheus you will need to patch the dashboards to change the datasource uid to be `grafanacloud-prom` as below.»\\n[3] «If memory is not dropping and is staying very close to the [GOMEMLIMIT](/blog/gomemlimit-a-game-changer-for-high-memory-applications), you may need to increase resources. ```\\ngo_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes\\n```\\n\\n### Batch Latency\\n\\nBatch latency is important as batch operations are the most efficient way to write data to\\nWeaviate. Monitoring this can give an indication if there is a problem with indexing data. This metric has a label `operation` which\\nallows you to see how long objects, vectors, and inverted index sub operations take. If you are using a [vectorizer module](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules) you will see additional latency due to the overhead of sending data to the module.»\\n[4] «In other words, the more the user imports, the more the heap will grow. That makes it quite unpredictable to know what live heap we will end up with eventually. In other words, Weaviate – like any other memory-intensive Go application – is a perfect candidate to benefit from GOMEMLIMT. It also comes out of the box with [Prometheus-compatible monitoring](/developers/weaviate/configuration/monitoring), so it should be easy to visualize the heap usage. For this experiment, we will use the latest Weaviate version compiled with Go 1.19.»\\n[5] «The schema is the place to define, among other things, the data type and vectorizer to be used, as well as cross-references between classes. As a corollary, the vectorization process can be modified for each class by setting the relevant schema options. In fact, you can [define the data schema](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/collections) for each class individually. All this means that you can also use the schema to tweak Weaviate\\'s vectorization behavior. The relevant variables for vectorization are `dataType` and those listed under `moduleConfig` at both the class level and property level.»\\n\\nQuestion: Should the `go_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes` metric be present in Weaviate even if the schema is empty, and what is its expected behavior under load?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to understand the context provided, which discusses Weaviate, a tool for managing and monitoring data. We also need to refer to the specific statements related to the \\'go_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes\\' metric. The context mentions that the \\'go_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes\\' metric should always be present, even with an empty schema. It is listed as one of the key Weaviate metrics to monitor. This indicates that this particular metric is essential for understanding the performance and behavior of Weaviate. Under load, the expected behavior of the \\'go_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes\\' metric is described as a standard jagged pattern. This suggests that memory usage will fluctuate, but it should also drop periodically due to Go garbage collection. This garbage collection process helps to manage memory usage and prevent excessive memory consumption.\\n\\nAnswer: Yes, the \\'go_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes\\' metric should be present in Weaviate even if the schema is empty. Under load, this metric is expected to exhibit a jagged pattern, with periodic drops in memory usage due to Go garbage collection.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «One of the primary reasons is the computational cost associated with processing and storing longer sequences of tokens. The longer the sequence, the more memory and processing power required to operate on it, which can be a significant challenge for even the most powerful computing systems. The relatively long input window of LLMs is what drives the integration with semantic search. For example, we can use this entire blog post as input in addition to questions if we want the LLM to answer questions such as “What are LLM Chains?” However, when we want to give the LLM an entire book or pages of search results, we need more clever techniques to decompose this task. This is where the `CombineDocuments` chain comes to play! Note, that one method is not better than another, and the performance is dependent solely on your application.»\\n[2] «Then we take this new query and hit the Weaviate vector database to get context to answer the question. The ChatVectorDB chain we use has a default value of k = 4 search results, if we use longer search results we will need another CombineDocuments chain here as well! With the 4 search results, we answer the question with this final prompt:\\n\\n```python\\nPrompt_template = \"\"\"Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know, don\\'t try to make up an answer. {context}\\nQuestion: {question}\\nHelpful Answer:\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\nHopefully this was a nice look under the hood of how the ChatVectorDB chain works. Let’s get into how we can use this with Weaviate!\\n\\n### The Code\\n\\nIf this is your first time using Weaviate, please check out the [Quickstart tutorial](/developers/weaviate/quickstart).»\\n[3] «We will look at the [ChatVectorDB chain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/popular/chat_vector_db), it lets you build an LLM that stores chat history and retrieves context from Weaviate to help with generation. To begin, the chat history in this chain uses the `stuff` configuration of CombineDocuments. This means we take as much of the chat history as we can fit in our context window and use it for a query reformulation prompt. The prompt is as follows:\\n\\n```python\\n_template = \"\"\"Given the following conversation and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question. Chat History:\\n{chat_history}\\nFollow Up Input: {question}\\nStandalone question:\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\nWe put the chat_history and the latest user input in the curly bracket syntax.»\\n[4] «Further reading [Why Is Vector Search So Fast?](https://weaviate.io/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast)\\n\\n## Use Cases of Vector Databases\\n\\nVector databases’ search capabilities can be used in various applications ranging from classical Machine Learning use cases, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender systems, to providing long-term memory to LLMs in modern applications. The **most popular use case of vector search engines is naturally for search**. Because a vector database can help find similar objects, it is predestined for applications where you might want to find similar products, movies, books, songs, etc. That’s why vector search engines are also **used in recommendation systems** as a restated task of search. With the rise of LLMs, **vector databases have already been used to enhance modern Generative AI applications**.»\\n[5] «Since around [80% of all data is unstructured](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/29/the-80-blind-spot-are-you-ignoring-unstructured-organizational-data/), it is hard to actually search and retrieve insights from most of the data. The Weaviate vector database unlocks the potential of unstructured data. Searching by fuzzy terms and classification of rich data like free text becomes possible with Weaviate. It uses AI-driven indexing and search technologies to enable real-time text processing. With machine learning methods, Weaviate automatically classifies texts.»\\n\\nQuestion: Why are techniques like the `CombineDocuments` chain necessary for processing large texts with LLMs?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: Let\\'s break down the context to identify the key points that explain the need for techniques like the `CombineDocuments` chain. The context mentions that one of the primary challenges of processing large texts with LLMs is the computational cost and memory requirements. As the input sequence length increases, so do the processing power and memory needs, which can be a significant hurdle even for powerful computing systems. The `CombineDocuments` chain is introduced as a solution to this problem. It is a technique used to decompose large texts into manageable segments that can be more easily processed by LLMs. By taking portions of the chat history and user input, the `CombineDocuments` chain reformulates the question into a standalone query that can be answered using a smaller context window. Additionally, the context mentions that vector databases, such as Weaviate, are used in conjunction with LLMs to enhance their capabilities. Vector databases excel at searching and retrieving similar objects, making them useful for applications beyond just search, including recommendation systems and Generative AI. Weaviate, in particular, enables the search and retrieval of insights from unstructured data by using AI-driven indexing and search technologies.\\n\\nAnswer: Techniques like the `CombineDocuments` chain are necessary for processing large texts with LLMs because they help address the computational cost and memory requirements associated with longer input sequences. By decomposing the task and reformulating queries, the `CombineDocuments` chain enables LLMs to handle larger contexts without overwhelming their resource limitations. Additionally, vector databases like Weaviate further enhance the capabilities of LLMs by providing efficient search and retrieval capabilities for unstructured data.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «What does replication get us? A big one is *availability*. With no replication, any node being down will make its data unavailable. But in a Kubernetes setup composed of say, three Weaviate nodes (three Kubernetes “pods”) and a replication factor of three, you can have any one of the three nodes down and still reach consensus. This reflects Weaviate’s leaderless replication architecture, meaning any node can be down without affecting availability at a cluster level as long as the right data is available somewhere.»\\n[2] «<details>\\n  <summary>Optional: Try it yourself (with minikube)</summary>\\n\\nYou can try running a local, multi-node Weaviate cluster with `minikube`, which can conveniently run a local Kubernetes cluster. We note that deploying Weaviate on a cloud provider’s kubernetes service follows a similar process. <br/>\\n\\nFirst, install `minikube` and `helm` for your system by following these guides ([minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start), [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install)).

We can refer to the provided context, which outlines the process of setting up a local, multi-node Weaviate cluster using \\'minikube\\' and \\'helm\\'. First, we need to ensure that we have the necessary tools installed, including \\'minikube\\', \\'helm\\', and \\'kubectl\\'. Then, we can start a three-node minikube cluster using the provided command. To check the status and details of the nodes in the cluster, we can use the \\'kubectl get nodes\\' command, which will provide an overview of the nodes, including their status, roles, ages, and IP addresses. Once we have confirmed that the nodes are up and running, we can proceed with deploying Weaviate. We add the Weaviate helm repository to our local configuration and save the default values to a \\'values.yaml\\' file. We then edit this file to specify three replicas for the Weaviate deployment. Finally, we can deploy Weaviate using the provided \\'helm upgrade\\' command, which will create the Weaviate clusters with the specified number of replicas. By following these steps, we can check the status and details of nodes in the Kubernetes cluster and prepare to deploy Weaviate with three replicas.\\n\\nAnswer: To check the status and details of nodes in a Kubernetes cluster and prepare to deploy Weaviate with three replicas, follow these steps: 1. Install \\'minikube\\', \\'helm\\', and \\'kubectl\\' on your system. 2. Start a three-node minikube cluster using the command: \\'minikube start --nodes 3\\'. 3. Use \\'kubectl get nodes -o wide\\' to view the status and details of the nodes, including their roles, ages, IP addresses, and more. 4. Add the Weaviate helm repository to your local configuration with \\'helm repo add weaviate https://weaviate.github.io/weaviate-helm\\'. 5. Save the default configuration using \\'helm show values weaviate/weaviate > values.yaml\\'. 6. Edit \\'values.yaml\\' to specify three replicas by changing \\'replicas: 1\\' to \\'replicas: 3\\'. 7. Deploy Weaviate using the \\'helm upgrade\\' command provided in the context. By executing these steps, you can verify the status and details of the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster and set up the deployment of Weaviate with three replicas.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «For more information about this new feature, read this [blog post](/blog/ref2vec-centroid) by Connor Shorten.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of features, and not every library or database has the same features. |**Feature**|**Vector Library**|**Vector Database** (Weaviate as an example)|\\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\\n| Filtering (in combination with Vector Search)| No| Yes|\\n| Updatability (CRUD)| No (some do, e.g. hnswlib)| Yes|\\n| Incremental importing, concurrent reading while importing| No (some do, e.g. hnswlib) | Yes |\\n| Stores objects and vectors | No | Yes|\\n|Speed | Typically faster than full-blown database|  Typically slower than pure library|\\n| Performance optimized for | In-memory similarity search| End2end-callstack, including: vector search, object retrieval from persistent storage, optional inverted index filtering, network requests, etc.»\\n[2] «Vector Indexing Library\\n\\nSimilarly to vector databases, [vector libraries](https://weaviate.io/blog/vector-library-vs-vector-database) also enable fast vector search. However, vector libraries only store vector embeddings of data objects, and they store them in in-memory indexes. This results in two key differences:\\n\\n1. Updatability: The index data is immutable, and thus, no real-time updates are possible. 2.»\\n[3] «This is why we have **Vector Databases** and **Vector Libraries**. They both use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithm to search through vectors in a tiny fraction of the time. You can learn more about this topic from [\"Why Vectors Search is so Fast.\"](/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast)\\n\\n## The Big Question\\nSo, if both vector databases and vector libraries allow you to efficiently search through your vectors. What are the key differences between them, and why/when should you choose one over the other? ## Vector Libraries\\nVector libraries store vector embeddings in in-memory indexes, in order to perform similarity search.»\\n[4] «### Example Use Cases\\nVector libraries are commonly used for applications that do not have changing data. For example, academic information retrieval benchmarks are designed to test performance on a **static snapshot** of data.

The key idea here is that embeddings that are semantically similar to each other have a smaller distance between them. We can use [vector distance functions](/blog/distance-metrics-in-vector-search) like euclidean distance or cosine distance to determine if these objects are similar to other objects in the collection. However, to do this we need to compare the distances between the query vector and **every** vector in the collection. This type of calculation can be difficult to scale to millions or billions of vectors.»\\n\\nQuestion: What are the differences between vector libraries and vector databases like Weaviate in terms of features such as filtering, updatability, and performance?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: The context provides a comparison between vector libraries and vector databases, highlighting their key differences. By referring to the provided table and the subsequent explanations, we can identify the specific differences in terms of features, updatability, and performance.\\n\\nAnswer: Vector libraries and vector databases like Weaviate differ in several ways: 1. Filtering: Vector databases support filtering in combination with vector search, while vector libraries do not. 2. Updatability: Vector databases offer CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing real-time updates. Vector libraries, on the other hand, have immutable index data, making updates impossible. 3. Incremental Importing: Vector databases support incremental importing and concurrent reading while importing. While some vector libraries may offer this feature (e.g., hnswlib), it is not a standard capability. 4. Storage: Vector databases store both objects and vectors, whereas vector libraries only store vector embeddings. 5. Speed: Vector libraries are typically faster than full-blown databases due to their in-memory nature. Vector databases are optimized for the end-to-end call stack, which includes various operations beyond just vector search. 6. Performance Optimization: Vector libraries are optimized for in-memory similarity search, making them efficient for specific tasks. Vector databases, on the other hand, are optimized for the entire end-to-end call stack, including vector search, object retrieval, filtering, and network requests. In summary, vector libraries are suitable for applications with static data and in-memory similarity search requirements. Vector databases, like Weaviate, are preferred when you need to store objects and vectors together, perform updates, and have additional features like filtering and CRUD operations.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «![Cross-Encoder](./img/cross-encoder.png)\\n\\n*Figure 3 - Representation of a Cross-Encoder model*\\n\\n\\nIf a Cross-Encoder model is trained on a representative training set, it [achieves higher accuracy than Bi-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084). However, since you need to use the Cross-Encoder model during a search for every single data item in combination with the query, this method is very inefficient. For a real-life semantic search application – with thousands or millions of objects – this would be impractical, as it would take \"forever\" to perform the search. ## Combining Bi-Encoders and Cross-Encoders\\n\\nWe can combine the two methods to benefit from the strong points of both models! I\\'d like to illustrate this idea with an example. Imagine you are a fisherman who is looking for salmon in a sea full of fish of numerous species.»\\n[2] «Bi-Encoders are fast, but are not as accurate as the expensive fisherman aka the Cross-Encoder. Cross-Encoders are time-consuming, like the fisherman who would need to limit the number of fishing rounds they could do. So we can chain those two methods behind each other (see Figure 5). First, you use a Bi-Encoder to retrieve a *list of result candidates*, then you use a Cross-Encoder on this list of candidates to pick out (or rerank) the most relevant results. This way, you benefit from the efficient retrieval method using Bi-Encoders and the high accuracy of the Cross-Encoder, so you can use this on large scale datasets!\\n\\n![Multistage search pipeline](./img/weaviate-pipeline-long.png)\\n\\n*Figure 5 - Multistage search pipeline using Weaviate*\\n\\n## Pre-trained Cross-Encoder models\\n\\nAs noted, Cross-Encoders can achieve high *in-domain* accuracy.»\\n[3] «---\\ntitle: Using Cross-Encoders as reranker in multistage vector search\\nslug: cross-encoders-as-reranker\\nauthors: [laura]\\ndate: 2022-08-09\\ntags: [\\'search\\']\\nimage: ./img/hero.png\\ndescription: \"Learn about bi-encoder and cross-encoder machine learning models, and why combining them could improve the vector search experience.\"\\n---\\n![Using Cross-Encoders as reranker in multistage vector search](./img/hero.png)\\n\\n<!-- truncate -->\\n\\nSemantic search overcomes the shortcomings of keyword-based search.

The context discusses the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in machine learning models, specifically in the context of semantic search. Semantic search aims to understand the context and semantics of data and queries, and it relies on machine learning models for this task. Cross-Encoders are introduced as highly accurate models for semantic search. However, the issue lies in their computational expense. When performing a search, a Cross-Encoder model needs to process every single data item in combination with the query. This means that for large datasets with thousands or millions of objects, the search process becomes extremely time-consuming and inefficient.\\n\\nAnswer: Cross-Encoders are considered impractical for semantic search applications with large datasets because they are computationally expensive and inefficient. The need to process every data item individually during a search makes it time-consuming and impractical for large-scale datasets.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «With a calculated host listings count of 1 and availability of 365 days a year, you can be sure to find a spot here.

If the live heap is low (e.g., 100MB), we can delay the next GC cycle until the heap has doubled (200MB). But if the heap has grown close to our limit (e.g., 4GB), the GC runs more often to prevent us from ever running OOM. ### Why a soft limit? What is the difference between a soft and a hard limit?»\\n[2] «* We could complete our full import without problems. * The memory usage never exceeded our soft limit of 2.75GiB and, therefore, never our hard limit of 3GiB. * GOMEMLIMIT made the GC more aggressive when less memory was available but kept it pretty relaxed when there was plenty. ## Conclusion: GOMEMLIMIT is a game-changer!\\nWe have covered quite a few points in this article, so let me summarize the key takeaways:\\n* Memory is either allocated on the stack (cheap) or the heap (expensive). Long-lived memory must live on the heap.»\\n[3] «The Go authors explicitly label GOMEMLIMIT a \"soft\" limit. That means that the Go runtime does not guarantee that the memory usage will exceed the limit. Instead, it uses it as a target. The goal is to fail fast in an impossible-to-solve situation: Imagine we set the limit to a value just a few kilobytes larger than the live heap. The GC would have to run constantly.»\\n[4] «With the new parameter, I will invoke Weaviate like this:\\n\\n```\\ndocker run -it \\\\\\n  -m 3GiB \\\\\\n  -e \"GOMEMLIMIT=2750MiB\" \\\\\\n  -e \"GOGC=100\" \\\\\\n  -e \"PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH=/var/lib/weaviate\" \\\\\\n  -e \"AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED=true\" \\\\\\n  -e \"PROMETHEUS_MONITORING_ENABLED=true\" \\\\\\n  -e \"CLUSTER_HOSTNAME=node1\" \\\\\\n  -e \"GODEBUG=gctrace=1\" \\\\\\n  -v \"$PWD/data:/var/lib/weaviate\" \\\\\\n  -p \"8080:8080\" \\\\\\n  -p \"2112:2112\" \\\\\\n  weaviate\\n```\\n\\nNow it\\'s time to run the same experiment again… and, I have some good news! The import succeeded. Let\\'s run a quick sanity check to prove that there are indeed 400,000 objects imported:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl localhost:8080/v1/graphql \\\\\\n  -H \\'content-type: application/json\\' \\\\\\n  -d \\'{\"query\":\"{Aggregate{Example{meta{count}}}}\"}\\'\\n\\n{\"data\":{\"Aggregate\":{\"Example\":[{\"meta\":{\"count\":400000}}]}}}\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, the imports are all present, let\\'s take a look at the heap usage according to the Prometheus metrics:\\n\\n![GOMEMLIMIT helps to collect garbage before a OOM crash](./img/gomemlimit-in-action.jpg)\\n\\nThe chart shows exactly what we expected:\\n* At no time did the test exceed our hard 3GiB limit (hence no OOM kill)\\n* As it approached the limit the heap hovered around our configured 2750MiB GOMEMLIMIT\\n* After the import finished, the stable long-lived heap dropped to just above 2GiB\\n\\nLet us also take a look at the most recent GC log:\\n\\n```\\ngc 313 @692.771s 2%: 0.36+393+0.13 ms clock,\\n5.7+337/1572/1065+2.1 ms cpu,\\n2214->2272->2039 MB,\\n2296 MB goal, 0 MB stacks, 0 MB globals, 16 P\\n```\\n\\nAgain, this log output backs up our claims from above:\\n* After completing the import, the live heap is just over 2GiB (2039MB)\\n* As we got closer to our soft limit, the heap goal was no longer twice the live heap. Instead, it is barely above the live heap at 2296MB. * The Go runtime has done a conscious trade-off to sacrifice a bit of CPU time to prevent us from running OOM. We can see that the self-reported cost of GC is now at 2%\\n\\n### In summary, how did GOMEMLIMIT save us from OOM?»\\n[5] «A stack allocation is short-lived and typically very cheap. No Garbage Collection is required for a stack allocation as the end of the function is also the end of the variable\\'s lifetime. On the other hand, a heap allocation is long-lived and considerably more expensive. When allocating onto the heap, the runtime must find a contiguous piece of memory where the new variable fits. Additionally, it must be garbage-collected when the variable is no longer used.»\\n\\nQuestion: What is the role of GOMEMLIMIT in garbage collection cycles, and how does it differ when the live heap is low versus when it is near the limit?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to understand the role of GOMEMLIMIT in managing memory usage and its impact on garbage collection cycles. GOMEMLIMIT is a \"soft\" limit introduced in the Go programming language to optimize memory usage and prevent out-of-memory (OOM) situations. It is a target value that guides the garbage collector (GC) but is not strictly enforced. When the live heap is low: - GOMEMLIMIT allows the GC cycle to be delayed. The GC runs less frequently, conserving resources and improving performance. - The GC is more relaxed, as there is plenty of memory available, and it can take its time to collect and manage memory efficiently. When the live heap is near the limit: - GOMEMLIMIT triggers the GC to run more often. It becomes more aggressive to prevent an OOM situation. - The GC tries to keep the memory usage below the soft limit, sacrificing some CPU time if needed. It becomes a conscious trade-off between memory usage and CPU usage. - The goal of the GC is no longer to double the live heap but to stay barely above it, ensuring that memory usage remains within manageable limits.\\n\\nAnswer: GOMEMLIMIT plays a crucial role in optimizing garbage collection cycles by providing a target memory limit. When the live heap is low, GOMEMLIMIT delays GC cycles and allows for a more relaxed collection. However, when the live heap is near the limit, GOMEMLIMIT triggers more frequent and aggressive GC cycles to prevent OOM. This adaptive behavior ensures efficient memory management and prevents potential crashes due to memory constraints.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «In addition to these two models, however, you can use any model from the Hugging Face Hub (or your own) by following [this guide](/developers/weaviate/modules/reader-generator-modules/sum-transformers#use-another-summarization-module-from-hugging-face). Even when looking only at language models that are trained for summarization tasks, there is still a wide range of choices in terms of sheer numbers, which vary in the target domain (e.g. medical, legal, scientific, etc.) and size (number of parameters, i.e. speed).

In this sense, \"long\" is used to describe text documents that significantly exceed the 512 token input limit on Deep Transformer Neural Networks. This problem is a large part of what motivates our interest in Hybrid Search techniques that combine the flexibility of Vector Search with the sparse BM25 word counting algorithm well suited for >512 token text sequences. We think Ref2Vec can also help address this challenge. To be clear, Weaviate already offers a solution to represent long documents with Cross-References! As an example, [the Wikipedia Demo](https://github.com/weaviate/semantic-search-through-wikipedia-with-weaviate) breaks the long Wikipedia articles into a (Paragraph, inArticle, Article) data schema in which each Paragraph contains less than 512 tokens of text.»\\n[2] «We can then vectorize this text description using off-the-shelf models from OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and others to unlock semantic search. We recently presented an example of this idea for [AirBnB listings](https://weaviate.io/blog/generative-feedback-loops-with-llms), translating tabular data about each property’s price, neighborhood, and more into a text description. Huge thanks to Svitlana Smolianova for creating the following animation of the concept. <img\\n    src={require(\\'./img/gen-example.gif\\').default}\\n    alt=\"alt\"\\n    style={{ width: \"100%\" }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Text Chunking\\nSimilarly related to the 512 token length for vectorizing text chunks, we may consider using the Large Language Model to identify good places to cut up text chunks. For example, if we have a list of items, it might not be best practice to separate the list into 2 chunks because the first half fell into the tail end of a chunk[:512] loop.»\\n[3] «This topic is heavily related to our perspectives on continual optimization of Deep Learning models, discussed further in “Orchestrating Tuning”. Chunking your data is an important step before inserting your data into Weaviate. Chunking takes long documents and converts it into smaller sections. This enhances the retrieval since each chunk has an important nugget of information and this helps to stay within the LLMs token limit. There are quite a few strategies to parse documents.»\\n[4] «When dealing with dimensions ranging from 8 to 128, we found that using AVX-256 instructions with loop unrolling yields the most favorable results. In the past, we conducted experiments with AVX-512 to assess its performance potential. However, the results didn’t show a significant increase in performance, particularly on older Intel processors. This lack of notable improvement could be due to thermal and power constraints in these older processor architectures. Such constraints could lead to [reductions in CPU frequency](https://lemire.me/blog/2018/09/07/avx-512-when-and-how-to-use-these-new-instructions/), limiting the capacity of AVX-512 instructions to deliver enhanced performance under these conditions.»\\n[5] «| When you want to control the batch size. |\\n| `rate_limit` | The number of objects sent to Weaviate is rate limited (specified as n_objects per minute). | When you want to avoid hitting third-party vectorization API rate limits. |\\n\\n<Tabs groupId=\"languages\">\\n    <TabItem value=\"wcs\" label=\"Dynamic\">\\n        <FilteredTextBlock\\n            text={PythonCode}\\n            startMarker=\"# START BatchDynamic\"\\n            endMarker=\"# END BatchDynamic\"\\n            language=\"py\"\\n        />\\n    </TabItem>\\n    <TabItem value=\"local\" label=\"Fixed size\">\\n        <FilteredTextBlock\\n            text={PythonCode}\\n            startMarker=\"# START BatchFixedSize\"\\n            endMarker=\"# END BatchFixedSize\"\\n            language=\"py\"\\n        />\\n    </TabItem>\\n    <TabItem value=\"embedded\" label=\"Rate limit\">\\n        <FilteredTextBlock\\n            text={PythonCode}\\n            startMarker=\"# START BatchRateLimit\"\\n            endMarker=\"# END BatchRateLimit\"\\n            language=\"py\"\\n        />\\n    </TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n#### Error handling in batch operations\\n\\nThe `v4` client introduces additional error handling operations.

This ensures that meaningful segments of text remain together, even if they exceed the 512 token limit. Additionally, the text chunking process is an important step in optimizing retrieval and ensuring compliance with LLM token limits.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «You can find other dev container templates [here](https://containers.dev/templates). **Step 2.

Upon interacting with ChatGPT while the plugin is enabled it can be instructed to use a particular endpoint via prompt but will also independently decide when to use the appropriate endpoint to complete the response to a query! These endpoints are what extend the functionality of ChatGPT and enable it to interact with the vector database. We developed these three endpoints through test driven development, as such we will display the tests that each endpoint must first pass and then the implementation that satisfies these tests. In preparation to setup the Weaviate instance for these tests we added the following test documents through a fixture:\\n```python\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef documents(weaviate_client):\\n    docs = [\\n        {\"text\": \"The lion is the king of the jungle\", \"document_id\": \"1\"},\\n        {\"text\": \"The lion is a carnivore\", \"document_id\": \"2\"},\\n        {\"text\": \"The lion is a large animal\", \"document_id\": \"3\"},\\n        {\"text\": \"The capital of France is Paris\", \"document_id\": \"4\"},\\n        {\"text\": \"The capital of Germany is Berlin\", \"document_id\": \"5\"},\\n    ]\\n\\n    for doc in docs:\\n        client.post(\"/upsert\", json=doc)\\n```\\n\\n**Implementing the `/upsert` endpoint:**\\n\\nAfter using the `/upsert` endpoint we mainly want to test that that we got the appropriate status code in addition to checking that the content, id and vector’s were all upserted correctly.

You need to be very careful about how you describe your plugin and endpoints to ChatGPT so that they can be used as intended! The `openapi.json` spec that FastAPI generates for you is based on how you documented the endpoints in your code i.e. the function’s name, docstring, query description and the field’s description in your pydantic models. The steps used to do this are outside the scope of this blog post, for more details please refer to the FastAPI documentation. In general you want to have complete and comprehensive documentation for your plugin because the documentation is what will allow it to be used correctly!\\n\\nAdditionally you have to be careful when specifying the descriptions, doc strings etc. not to exceed the context length since the plugin description, API requests, and API responses are all inserted into the conversation with ChatGPT.»\\n[5] «<br/>\\n\\nJust like that, you’ve got a multi-node Weaviate cluster.

Define the endpoint route: We want our endpoint to be accessible at the root URL \"/\", so we define it using the `@app.get(\"/\")` decorator. 2. Create a function for the endpoint: We need a function that will be executed when the endpoint is accessed. In this case, we want to return `{\"Hello\": \"World\"}`. 3. Add a docstring to the function: Although not necessary for the functionality, adding a docstring helps with documentation and understanding the purpose of the endpoint. 4. Return the desired JSON object: Inside the function, we simply return `{\"Hello\": \"World\"}`.\\n\\nAnswer: Here\\'s the code snippet that creates the dummy endpoint: ```python from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): \"\"\" Say hello to the world \"\"\" return {\"Hello\": \"World\"} ``` This code defines a FastAPI app and creates an endpoint at \"/\" using the `@app.get(\"/\")` decorator. The `read_root()` function is executed when the endpoint is accessed, and it returns `{\"Hello\": \"World\"}`. The docstring provides a description of the endpoint\\'s purpose.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «Head to the [documentation](/developers/weaviate/configuration/backups) for a more in-depth overview and instructions. ## Reduced memory usage\\n\\n![Reduced memory usage](./img/reduced-memory-usage.jpg)\\n\\nAs part of the continuous effort to make Weaviate faster, leaner and more powerful, we introduced new optimizations to use less RAM without sacrificing performance. ### Thread pooling optimization\\n\\nFirst, we set our sights on parallel imports, where we introduced thread pooling to reduce memory spikes while importing data. Previously if you had, e.g., 8 CPUs and would import from 4 client threads, each client request would run with a parallelization factor of 8 (one per CPU core). So, in the worst case, you could end up with 32 parallel imports (on a machine with \"only\" 8 CPUs).»\\n[2] «There is no performance gain if we have more parallelization than there are available CPUs. However, each thread needs additional memory. So with 32 parallel imports, we had the worst of both worlds: High memory usage and no performance gains beyond 8. With the fix, even if you import from multiple clients, Weaviate automatically handles the parallelization to ensure that it does not exceed the number of CPU cores. As a result, you get the maximum performance without \"unnecessary\" memory usage. ### HNSW optimization\\n\\nNext, we optimized memory allocations for the HNSW (vector) index.»\\n[3] «[Better control over Garbage Collector](#better-control-over-garbage-collector) - with the introduction of GOMEMLIMIT we gained more control over the garbage collector, which significantly reduced the chances of OOM kills for your Weaviate setups. 1.

This optimization ensures that the number of parallel imports doesn\\'t exceed the number of CPU cores, reducing memory spikes and providing maximum performance without unnecessary memory usage.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «Similarly to the original Gorilla paper’s use of Abstract Syntax Tree evaluation, we are also considering an n-gram match where we construct keywords for each query such as “bm25”, “query”, “title” and check how many are contained in the generated query. We can also use the finer-grained perplexity metric that measures the log probability of the ground truth tokens at each step of decoding. We are currently using a simple greedy decoding algorithm to sample from the LoRA fine-tuned LlaMA 7B LLM.

The Ref2Vec module currently holds the name ref2vec-**centroid** because it uses the average, or centroid vector, of the cross-referenced vectors to represent the **referencing** object.\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \"_additional\": {\\n            \"rerank\": [\\n              {\\n                \"score\": 4.7478566e-06\\n              }\\n            ]\\n          },\\n          \"content\": \"## More Coming Soon\\\\nWe are very excited about the potential of Ref2Vec, and how it leverages existing symbolic data to augment vector searches in a new way.»\\n\\nQuestion: What is the syntax error in the provided GraphQL query example related to the evaluation of n-gram matches?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: Let\\'s think step by step to identify the syntax error in the provided GraphQL query example and how it relates to the evaluation of n-gram matches. We\\'ll start by examining the query and identifying any discrepancies from the expected syntax.\\n\\nAnswer: The syntax error in the provided GraphQL query example is the missing comma between the `bm25` and `where` fields. This error would prevent the query from executing successfully and is thus relevant to the evaluation of n-gram matches, as it affects the structure and validity of the query.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «#### Test\\nWe designed an extreme stress test that would represent the \"worst-case\" scenario for recovery. It has multiple very large, independent Write-Ahead Logs that required for recovery. Before, this could take many hours to recover, while now it takes only a few seconds. ### Full changelog\\nThese are few of the many improvements and bug fixes that were included in this release. Check out [the changelog](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/releases/tag/v1.14.0) to see the complete list.»\\n[2] «#### Problem\\nIf Weaviate encounters an unexpected crash, no data will be lost. To provide this guarantee, a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is in place. If a crash had occurred, the WAL is parsed at startup, and all previously unfinished operations are recovered, even if they were part of in-memory structures that had not yet been flushed. While this system is very safe, the recovery could be slow for several reasons:\\n\\n- Unflushed memtables could become very large. This would lead to a lot of data that needs to be recovered after a crash\\n- The recovery process was single-threaded.»\\n[3] «#### Solution\\nWe addressed each of the points above individually and improved the overall MTTR substantially:\\n\\n- A deduplication process was added, so that large WALs with a lot of updates (i.e. redundant data) could be reduced to only the necessary information. - The recovery process now runs in parallel. If there are multiple places that require recovery, they can each recover independently, without one recovery having to wait for the other. - A mechanism was added that flushes any memtable that has been idle (no writes) for 60s or more. In addition to speeding up the recovery, this change also ensures that no recovery is needed at all in many cases.»\\n[4] «To attach to the logs of a specific containers you can run:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker compose logs -f <container-name>\\n```\\n\\nfor example:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker compose logs -f weaviate\\n```\\n\\nYou can also omit the -d option and keep your terminal attached to all logs. To see the names and status of each container you can run:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker compose ps\\n```\\n\\n## How do I know when Weaviate is up and ready? Weaviate implements a readiness check at `GET /v1/.well-known/ready`. It will return a `2xx` HTTP status code once everything is ready. To check for the readiness programmatically you can use `curl` in this simple `bash` loop:\\n\\n```bash\\nuntil curl --fail -s localhost:8080/v1/.well-known/ready; do\\n  sleep 1\\ndone\\n```\\n\\nMake sure to adjust localhost:8080 if you are running on a different bind address.»\\n[5] «We were able to import 200 million objects and more, while the import performance remained constant throughout the process. [See more on github](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/pull/1976). ### Drastically improved Mean-Time-To-Recovery (MTTR)\\nWeaviate `1.14` fixes an issue where a crash-recovery could take multiple minutes, or even hours in some extreme cases. It is now a matter of just seconds. So even in the rare event that your instance crashes, it will come back up very quickly.»\\n\\nQuestion: How was the MTTR improved in the system with regards to handling large write-ahead logs?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer by understanding the problem and the solutions implemented. In the given context, the problem is that the recovery process for Write-Ahead Logs (WALs) could be slow, especially with large unflushed memtables and a single-threaded recovery process.\\n\\nAnswer: The MTTR was improved by addressing the following: 1. Deduplication of large WALs: By adding a deduplication process, redundant data in the WALs is removed, reducing the recovery time. 2. Parallel recovery: The recovery process now runs in parallel, allowing multiple places requiring recovery to work independently and simultaneously, improving the speed. 3. Idle memtable flushing: Any memtable idle for 60 seconds or more is flushed, reducing the amount of data that needs to be recovered and ensuring faster recovery. These changes ensure that the recovery process for large WALs is faster and more efficient, improving the overall MTTR of the system.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «---\\ntitle: Weaviate 2023 Recap\\nslug: 2023-recap\\nauthors: [femke]\\ndate: 2023-12-26\\ntags: []\\nimage: ./img/hero.png\\ndescription: \"A reflection on 2023 from team Weaviate!\"\\n---\\n![hero](img/hero.png)\\n\\n<!-- truncate -->\\n\\nIt’s hard to imagine that less than a year ago, so very few people even knew about the concept of vector databases and how AI could benefit from them.

It mentions a slowdown in the import process, but does not explicitly state the number of imported objects at which this slowdown occurs. Question: At what number of imported objects did the slowdown begin according to the document? Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to carefully examine the relevant portions of the provided context. The text mentions a slowdown in the import process, but does not provide a specific number of imported objects at which this slowdown starts. However, it gives us a range to work with. The relevant excerpt from the context is: \"[3] «But once the database got to around 25 million objects, adding new objects would be significantly slower. Then from 50–100m, the import process would slow down to a walking pace.\" Here, the document is stating that at around 25 million objects, the import process started to become noticeably slower. However, it also mentions that the import process further slowed down to a \"walking pace\" between 50 and 100 million objects. Therefore, we can conclude that the slowdown began around 25 million imported objects, but it became more pronounced and significant as the number of objects increased toward 50 million and beyond.\\n\\nAnswer: The slowdown in the import process began around 25 million imported objects, but it became more significant as the number of objects approached 50 million and beyond.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «1**: *Suppose we have vectors $x$ and $y$ represented in their original space.

This calculation involves a straightforward exclusive OR (XOR) operation between two binary arrays, tallying the resulting ones. Moreover, Go offers SIMD-optimized operations for these binary functions, resulting in notably faster computation than with original vectors. But how much faster exactly?»\\n[3] «## Vector Distance Calculations\\n\\nVector databases use vector representations generated from machine learning models to capture the meaning of data. The fact that these vectors are numerical representations of data objects allows us to apply mathematical operations to them, such as calculating the distance between two vector representations to determine their similarity. To calculate the distance between two vectors, you can use several similarity measures, detailed below:\\n\\n\\n![Vector Distance Calculations](./img/vector_distance.png)\\n\\n\\nAs you can see, there are many different similarity measures - cosine, dot product or euclidean (also know as L2) are the most commonly used in practice. To learn more about the different distance metrics, you can continue reading our blog post on [What are Distance Metrics in Vector Search?](/blog/distance-metrics-in-vector-search/)\\n\\nWhen a vector database needs to retrieve semantically similar objects it has to calculate one of these distance metrics to assess how close a query point is to candidate points in the database. In fact, this vector distance calculation needs to be conducted when you build the index as well as anytime you perform any CRUD operation.»\\n[4] «The next natural question is: How do we compress vectors? ## How to Efficiently Compress Vectors\\n\\nThe main idea behind vector compression is to have a “good-enough” representation of the vectors (as opposed to a perfect representation) so they take up less space in memory while still allowing us to calculate the distance between them in a performant and accurate way. Compression could come from different sources. We could, for example, aim to reduce redundant data to store information more efficiently. We could also sacrifice accuracy in the data in favor of space.»\\n[5] «What simple operation does it spend the majority of its time performing? If you guessed **vector distance calculations** … BINGO! 🎉\\n\\nWhile vector databases use many techniques and algorithms to improve performance (including locality graphs, quantization, hash based approaches), at the end of the day, efficient distance calculations between high-dimensional vectors is a requirement for a good vector database. In fact, when profiling Weaviate indexed using HNSW, we find that 40%-60% of the CPU time is spent doing vector distance calculations.

We explain how we attained a **~40% QPS speed up at 90% Recall** in Weaviate running on Intel’s new Xeon Processor, Emerald Rapids.»\\n\\nQuestion: What is the impact of vector compression and decompression on the accuracy of distance calculations between the original vectors?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the answer to this question, we need to understand the impact of compression and decompression on the original vectors and how it affects the accuracy of distance calculations.\\n\\nAnswer: Vector compression and decompression can introduce distortion to the original vectors, and this distortion can affect the accuracy of distance calculations. The compression function $C$ applied to the original vectors $x$ and $y$ results in a shorter representation, but when these compressed vectors are decompressed back into the original space using $C\\'$, there is a slight difference in the reconstructed vectors $x\\'\\'$ and $y\\'\\'$. This distortion, denoted as $\\\\delta$, adds to the original distance calculation, so the new distance between $x$ and $y$ is given by $d(x, y) = d(x\\'\\', y\\'\\') + \\\\delta$. The impact of this distortion on the accuracy of distance calculations depends on the specific compression and decompression functions used and the similarity measure employed to calculate vector distances. In the context of Weaviate, the compression rate of 1:32 for floating-point vectors to `float32` arrays is mentioned, and it is stated that this compression allows for faster computation through bitwise operations. However, the specific impact on accuracy is not explicitly mentioned and would depend on the chosen similarity measure and the characteristics of the data being compressed. In general, vector compression techniques aim to find a balance between reducing storage requirements and maintaining the accuracy of vector operations. The choice of compression algorithm and the acceptable level of distortion depend on the specific use case and the sensitivity of the application to errors in vector calculations.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «It is one of my favorite topics about Go memory management, and I\\'d be happy to write this post. Please let me know. For this one, it\\'s enough to understand that sometimes heap-allocations happen even when we think they shouldn\\'t. That is important to know because those allocations will put pressure on the GC, which is required for an unexpected OOM situation. ## Why would you run OOM – even when there is enough memory available?»\\n[2] «In this article, I will invite you on a journey. We will cover:\\n* How memory allocations work in Go.\\n* When the Garbage Collector runs, and what the implications are. * Why it was far too easy to run out of memory before Go 1.19. * What GOMEMLIMT is and why it can prevent premature OOM kills. * Run an experiment first without and then with GOMEMLIMIT\\n\\n## What is a garbage-collected language?»\\n[3] «However, as the next few paragraphs show, there are some caveats (and a terrific new solution called GOMEMLIMIT). If you aren\\'t careful, you can run OOM even when you shouldn\\'t. But before we dive into this, we need to talk about stack and heap allocations and why something ends up on the heap. ## The stack vs. the heap\\nIn short, there are two ways to allocate memory: On the stack or the heap.»\\n[4] «We found that the data structures relied on dynamic allocations. So, even if we knew that an array would never be longer than 64 elements, the Go runtime could still decide to allocate an array[100] in the background when the array reaches 51 elements. To fix that, we switched to static allocations, and Weaviate instructs the Go runtime to allocate the exact number of elements. This reduced **static** memory usage even when idle. ### Results\\n\\n🎉 Between these two major updates, plus some smaller ones, we saw a **significant reduction in memory usage of 10-30%**🚀.»\\n[5] «* After introducing `GOMEMLIMIT=2750MiB`, our application no longer crashed and could efficiently use the available memory. The import succeeded. Does that mean that GOMEMLIMIT is your *get-out-of-jail-free* card for heap allocations? No. A Go application that gets heavy usage still has to ensure allocation efficiency. Simply setting a GOMEMLIMIT will not make an inefficient application efficient.»\\n\\nQuestion: Why can heap allocations in Go lead to out-of-memory errors even when there appears to be enough memory available?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to understand the memory management system in Go and the role of the Garbage Collector (GC). Go has automatic memory management, which means the Go runtime handles memory allocation and deallocation. Memory allocations can happen on the stack or the heap. The heap is a dynamic memory allocation area, and the stack is a static memory allocation area with a fixed size. When objects are allocated on the heap, the Go runtime keeps track of these allocations and their sizes. The Garbage Collector is then responsible for deallocating unused memory on the heap. However, the GC runs periodically, and if there are a large number of allocations happening in a short period, it can lead to a situation where the available memory is fragmented and not contiguous, even if the total memory available seems sufficient. Additionally, as mentioned in the context, the Go runtime may sometimes allocate more memory than what is apparently necessary. For example, in context [4], it is mentioned that an array of 51 elements was allocated as an array of 100 elements. This can further contribute to the issue of fragmented memory and unexpected out-of-memory (OOM) errors. Reasoning: Let\\'s understand this step by step to provide a comprehensive answer.\\n\\nAnswer: Heap allocations in Go can lead to out-of-memory errors, even when there seems to be enough memory available due to the dynamic nature of memory allocation on the heap and the periodic garbage collection process. The Go runtime may allocate more memory than needed, and if a large number of allocations occur in a short period, it can fragment the available memory. As a result, the GC may not be able to deallocate memory efficiently, leading to unexpected OOM errors.

Therefore, it is challenging to provide a general abstraction for agent evaluation. - The document mentions evaluating generations with a prompt that explains the needs for SQL and Vector Databases and then asking the LLM whether the router made the correct decision. - The RAGAS Context Relevance score can be used for the results of the SQL query to assess the agent\\'s performance. - Another aspect to consider is the decomposition of questions and the ability of the LLM to combine answers from sub-questions to answer the original question. - The visualization provided in the document illustrates an agent routing a query to either an SQL or a Vector Database query, showing the potential for LLMs to understand and facilitate structured searches efficiently.\\n\\nAnswer: The document discusses that it is too early to determine the standard patterns for agent evaluation as the field is constantly evolving. However, some key considerations for evaluating agents in the context of Multi-Index Routing and SQL and Vector Databases include: - Using prompts to explain the needs for SQL and Vector Databases and then assessing the LLM\\'s decision-making. - Employing the RAGAS Context Relevance score for evaluating the results of the SQL query. - Considering the decomposition of questions into sub-questions and the LLM\\'s ability to combine answers. - Visualizing agent query routing to either SQL or Vector Databases and understanding the efficiency of vector searches. - Evaluating the agent\\'s performance in open-ended planning loops, tool use, and meta internal memory management prompts.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «Note, how it doesn’t even mention the Cohere model, as all of that is done through configuration. ```python\\ndef semantic_serch(query):\\n   client = _setup.connect_to_weaviate()\\n\\n   nearText = {\\n       \"concepts\": [query],\\n       \"distance\": 0.7,\\n   }\\n\\n   properties = [\\n       \"name\", \"content\", \"enName\", \"link\", \"lang\",\\n       \"_additional {certainty distance}\"\\n   ]\\n\\n   result = (\\n       client.query\\n       .get(\"Document\", properties)\\n       .with_near_text(nearText)\\n       .with_limit(5)\\n       .do()\\n   )\\n\\n   return result[\\'data\\'][\\'Get\\'][\\'Document\\']\\n```\\n## How does this work\\nIt is also important to understand how Weaviate and Cohere communicate with each other. Weaviate fully automates communication with Cohere’s AI Platform. There are two key scenarios when Weaviate will communicate with Cohere:\\n\\n* Data import and modifications – to vectorize data objects\\n* Query time – to vectorize the query\\n\\n### Data import + modifications\\nWhen you import (or update) data into Weaviate, Weaviate will:\\n1. Receive the data object\\n1.»\\n[2] «But until now, getting outputs from Cohere into Weaviate required a few extra steps. This included sending requests to Cohere to vectorize text objects, retrieving the output vectors, and then importing it  into Weaviate along with the matching objects. ### Text2vec-cohere\\nOver the last few weeks, we’ve partnered with Cohere to create a new Weaviate module – [text2vec-cohere](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere) – it allows you to use Cohere’s LLMs to run complex NLP queries straight from Weaviate. You can learn all about [text2vec-cohere from the docs](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere).

The signature implements the prompt that: 1. Describes the task, 2. Gives an example of the `input` and `output` fields and 3.»\\n[5] «Capturing these variations is important for this specific use case and it’s also universally applicable to other use cases involving user reviews. But how did we accomplish this with Weaviate? The process is surprisingly straightforward. We created `Product` objects embedded with their reviews, summaries, and other metadata, to enable semantic search. To optimize performance, we vectorize specific fields using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and leave out fields that do not require vectorization.»\\n\\nQuestion: How does Weaviate process and vectorize queries using Cohere?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: Let\\'s break down the process step by step to understand how Weaviate utilizes Cohere for processing and vectorizing queries.\\n\\nAnswer: Weaviate, a powerful vector search engine, integrates with Cohere\\'s AI Platform to enhance its capabilities. Here\\'s how Weaviate processes and vectorizes queries using Cohere: 1. **Query Receipt**: When a query is received by Weaviate, it recognizes the need to vectorize the query text. 2. **Communication with Cohere**: Weaviate sends the query to Cohere\\'s AI Platform for vectorization. This communication is automated, thanks to the text2vec-cohere module, a collaboration between Weaviate and Cohere. 3. **Vectorization by Cohere**: Cohere\\'s large language models, such as the `command-nightly` model, perform complex natural language processing on the query. This includes understanding the query intent, generating chain-of-thought responses, and producing output vectors that represent the query\\'s semantic meaning. 4. **Query Execution**: Once the query is vectorized by Cohere, Weaviate uses this vector to search for relevant data objects in its database. It compares the query vector with the vectors of stored data objects to find the most similar matches. 5. **Result Retrieval**: Weaviate retrieves the data objects with vectors closest to the query vector and returns them as the query results. This ensures that the results are contextually relevant to the user\\'s query. By leveraging Cohere\\'s advanced language models, Weaviate can process and understand queries more effectively, enabling it to provide accurate and semantically meaningful search results. This integration enhances Weaviate\\'s capabilities in handling complex NLP queries and improves the overall user experience.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «Typically this is in the context of recommendation in which we have metadata about users, as well as the documents or items. So for example, say we have features that describe a Users looking for Movies such as:\\n\\nUser Features - (Age, Gender, Location, Occupation, Preferences)\\nMovie Features - (Release Year, Genre, Box Office, Duration). So together, the Metadata ranker takes as input something like: [Age, Gender, Location, Occupation, Preferences, Release year, Genre, Box Office, Duration] and predicts a score of how much this User will like the movie. We can fix the User features and rotate in each Document to get a score for each of the candidate movies (retrieved with something like ref2vec) to rank with. In addition to vectors, Weaviate also enables storing metadata features about objects such as `price`, or `color`.»\\n[2] «They offer the advantage of further reasoning about the relevance of results without needing specialized training. Cross Encoders can be interfaced with Weaviate to re-rank search results, trading off performance for slower search speed. * **Metadata Rankers** are context-based re-rankers that use symbolic features to rank relevance. They take into account user and document features, such as age, gender, location, preferences, release year, genre, and box office, to predict the relevance of candidate documents. By incorporating metadata features, these rankers offer a more personalized and context-aware search experience.»\\n[3] «However, most of the LLM APIs don’t actually give us these probabilities. Further, this is probably pretty slow. We will keep an eye on it, but it doesn’t seem like the next step to take for now. ## Metadata Rankers\\nWhereas I would describe Cross-Encoders as `content-based` re-ranking, I would say Metadata rankers are `context-based` re-rankers. Metadata rankers describe using symbolic features to rank relevance.»\\n[4] «We can send these features to wherever our Metadata Ranker is hosted and get those scores back to Weaviate to sort our search results. This is also closely related to another category of ranking methods that use models like XGBoost to combine features, as well as say the bm25 score, vector distance, and maybe even the cross encoder score as well. This is a pretty interesting technique when you additionally factor in multiple properties. For example, we could have a bm25, vector, and cross encoders for the `title`, as well as `content` properties and use a learned model to combine these into a final ranking score. I recently came across a paper titled “Injecting the BM25 Score as Text Improves BERT-Based Re-rankers” published in ECIR 2023.»\\n[5] «As described in our [previous article](https://weaviate.io/blog/ranking-models-for-better-search), re-ranking models are new to the scene of zero-shot generalization. The story of re-rankers has mostly been tabular user features combined with tabular product or item features, fed to XGBoost models. This required a significant amount of user data to achieve, which zero-shot generalization may stand to disrupt. Cross encoders have gained popularity by taking as input a `(query, document)` pair and outputting a high precision relevance score. This can be easily generalized to recommendation as well, in which the ranker takes as input a `(user description, item description)` pair.»\\n\\nQuestion: How does the Metadata ranker predict which movies a user will like based on their personal features and movie characteristics?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Reasoning: To answer this question, we need to understand how the Metadata Ranker utilizes user and movie data to make predictions. We can break down the process into the following steps: Step 1: Understand User Features: The Metadata Ranker takes into account various user features such as age, gender, location, occupation, and preferences. These features provide a personalized profile of the user, allowing the system to tailor movie recommendations accordingly. Step 2: Analyze Movie Metadata: For each movie, the ranker considers metadata such as release year, genre, box office performance, and duration. This information helps match movies to the user\\'s tastes and preferences. Step 3: Combine User and Movie Data: By integrating user features with movie metadata, the Metadata Ranker can make context-aware predictions. It predicts a score or ranking for each movie, indicating how much the user is likely to enjoy it. Step 4: Rank and Recommend: Finally, the movies are ranked based on the predicted scores, and the system can recommend movies with the highest predicted relevance or appeal to the user.\\n\\nAnswer: The Metadata Ranker utilizes user features (e.g., age, gender, preferences) and movie characteristics (e.g., genre, release year) to predict a score indicating how much a user will like a particular movie. By combining these features, the ranker can provide personalized movie recommendations tailored to the user\\'s tastes and interests.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «Please boost relevance based on recency and if the Author is “Connor Shorten”. ```\\n\\nEach search result then comes packaged with their associated metadata in a key-value array. This offers the additional benefit of allowing business practitioners to easily swap out the ranking logic.

Secondly, it dramatically increases the interpretability of recommendation systems. By having the metadata packaged with the search results, LLMs can provide explanations for the ranking, making the system more transparent and understandable to users. This added interpretability can increase user trust and satisfaction.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «<div align=\"center\">\\n\\n![\"Bob talks about feedback loops\"](img/bob-gen-ai.jpg)\\n##### Our CEO Bob talking about the next level of vector database capabilities - Generative Feedback Loops\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nWe also got tons of great feedback on our open-source RAG app, Verba, which we used to demo Weaviate.

We know that there are a vast number of Sentence Transformer models available from Hugging Face, and that the Weaviate module provides access to these models for semantic search. The context provides some guidelines on how to choose the right model. Firstly, it is important to understand the differences in the models. The models can vary based on architectural decisions, the datasets they were trained on, and the language of the dataset. The specific domain the model is intended for is also a critical factor. For example, a model trained on French sentences will perform better for French sentence embeddings than a model trained on English sentences. The Hugging Face model cards provide color-coded details about each model, including the dataset, language, and additional information. These details can be used to select a model that aligns with the specific requirements of the semantic search use case.\\n\\nAnswer: To choose the right Sentence Transformer model from Hugging Face for Semantic Search, consider the following factors: - Language: Select a model that has been trained on a dataset in the same language as your semantic search use case. - Domain: Choose a model that is tailored to the specific domain of your data, such as legal, financial, biomedical, or general text. - Dataset: Review the Hugging Face model cards to understand the datasets the models were trained on and select one that aligns with your data. - Architectural differences: While not discussed in detail in the context, architectural decisions can also impact the performance of the model. Consider the specific architecture of each model and how it aligns with your requirements. By considering these factors and utilizing the information provided in the Hugging Face model cards, you can select the most suitable Sentence Transformer model for your semantic search application.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «---\\ntitle: Weaviate introduces an all-new business model for vector search\\nslug: weaviate-cloud-services\\nauthors: [bob]\\ndate: 2022-09-01\\ntags: [\\'release\\']\\nimage: ./img/hero.png\\ndescription: \"Press Release: Pay-as-you-grow comes to Vector Search.\"\\n---\\n![Weaviate introduces an all-new business model for vector search](./img/hero.png)\\n\\n<!-- truncate -->\\n\\n**Amsterdam NL - September 1, 2022**\\n\\nWeaviate, the leader in open-source vector database technology, announces an [entirely new pricing model](/pricing) for its Weaviate Cloud.

You can learn more about our security standards [here](https://weaviate.io/security). ## Application of GenAI and Weaviate in Business Use Cases\\n\\nEnough with features, what are some applications of Weaviate and GenAI in the enterprise? Across many of our customers, there are a few common architectural patterns in the applications they are building.»\\n[4] «---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: What if you could understand your unstructured data? slug: understand-your-unstructured-data\\nauthors: [laura]\\ndate: 2021-01-20\\ntags: [\\'concepts\\']\\nimage: ./img/hero.png\\n# canonical-url: https://medium.com/semi-technologies/what-if-you-could-understand-your-unstructured-data-92f0861e016\\n# canonical-name: Medium\\ndescription: \"Learn how the AI-first vector database Weaviate unlocks the potential of unstructured data and why this is important.\"\\n---\\n![What if you could understand your unstructured data?](./img/hero.png)\\n\\n<!-- truncate -->\\n\\n## Intro\\nThese days, more and more organizations are adopting a data-driven culture. Business processes and customer experience benefit from good data collection, management and analysis. But in order to really benefit from available data, it is essential to also understand the unstructured data, like free text in PDF documents, emails, invoices or voice transcriptions. Unstructured data is especially hard to index, manage and understand.»\\n[5] «The model is deep learning neural network with many layers and weights distributed across the entire network representing the probablistic nature of your dataset. ![neural-network](./img/neural-network.png)\\n\\nThrough this simple input output system, we can leverage these foundational large language models to generate new content based on natural language prompts. And because they contain massive amounts of data, we don’t necessarily have to train custom neural networks to leverage their capabilities in real world business use cases. Beyond incredible innovation in drug discovery and chip design, these systems allow for the complete automation, or human in the loop based systems, to augment business to consumer experiences or increase enterprise output. ### Vector Databases\\n\\nVector databases are a fairly new class of database that is specifically designed to store and look up vector embeddings.»\\n\\nQuestion: What are the new capabilities available to Weaviate users for managing their business data?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to answer the question. We know from the context that Weaviate has introduced a new business model and pricing structure, but we also need to consider the integration with Confluent Cloud and the mention of data privacy and compliance.\\n\\nAnswer: Weaviate users now have access to new capabilities that enable them to manage their business data more effectively. Firstly, Weaviate introduced a \"pay-as-you-grow\" pricing model, making it more affordable for enterprises of any scale to adopt its vector database technology. This new business model allows users to pay a usage-based rate for search on a per-dimension basis, starting at $0.05 per million dimensions. Additionally, the integration with Confluent Cloud provides Weaviate users with access to data streams from across their entire business. This enables them to build a real-time, contextual, and trustworthy knowledge base that fuels their AI applications. By bridging the legacy and modern data stack, Confluent\\'s data streaming platform ensures a continuous supply of AI-ready data, helping enterprises develop sophisticated, context-aware AI applications. Furthermore, Weaviate supports various deployment models to address data privacy and compliance concerns. Enterprises can self-host Weaviate in their infrastructure using Docker or Kubernetes, deploy it into their own VPC in AWS or GCP marketplaces, or opt for Weaviate Cloud if their compliance requirements allow it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] «The following image presents a high-level illustration of chunking text. ![chunking](img/chunk.png)\\n\\n### Retrieval \\nThere are four major knobs to tune in Retrieval: Embedding models, Hybrid search weighting, whether to use AutoCut, and Re-ranker models. Most RAG developers may instantly jump to tuning the embedding model used, such as OpenAI, Cohere, Voyager, Jina AI, Sentence Transformers, and many others! Developers also need to consider the dimensionality of the models and how it affects the PQ compression. The next key decision is how to weight the aggregation of sparse and dense retrieval methods in Hybrid Search. The weighting is based on the `alpha` parameter.»\\n[2] «* **Index Construction:** LLMs can transform information to facilitate building search indexes. This can range from summarizing long content to extracting structured data, identifying text chunks, managing document updates, or transformation structured data to text for vectorization. * **LLMs in Re-Ranking:** Ranking models, distinctly from Retrieval, explicitly takes the query and/or a user description, as well as each candidate document as input to the neural network to output a fine-grained score of relevance. LLMs can now do this off-the-shelf without any extra training. Quite interestingly, we can prompt the LLMs to rank with symbolic preferences such as “price” or “recency”, in addition to the unstructured text content.»\\n[3] «---\\ntitle: Running Large Language Models Privately - privateGPT and Beyond\\nslug: private-LLM\\nauthors: zain\\ndate: 2023-05-30\\nimage: ./img/hero.png\\ntags: [\\'concepts\\',\\'how-to\\']\\ndescription: \"A discussion on data privacy and privacy-preserving machine learning for LLMs\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n![Private LLMs](./img/hero.png)\\n\\n<!-- truncate -->\\n\\nLarge Language Models (LLM’s) have revolutionized how we access and consume information, shifting the pendulum from a search engine market that was predominantly retrieval-based (where we asked for source documents containing concepts relevant to our search query), to one now that is growingly memory-based and performs generative search (where we ask LLMs to generate answers to questions based on their knowledge of and training on massive datasets). More importantly, what’s different this time is that with the advent of widely accessible products like ChatGPT that have exposed the underlying technology of these models to the wider consumer market, we’re seeing these models revolutionize how we work, learn and interact on a scale never seen before. This wide-scale adoption of LLMs makes the concerns and challenges around privacy and data security paramount, and ones that each organization needs to address. In this blog post we will explore some of the different potential approaches organizations can take to ensure robust data privacy while harnessing the power of these LLMs.\\n\\n## Understanding the Privacy Challenge\\n\\nLLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data to develop a statistical understanding of human language patterns. If you’d like to get an introductory explanation of how these models work, please read our previous blogpost: [How LLMs Work](/blog/what-are-llms).»\\n[4] «As described in our [previous article](https://weaviate.io/blog/ranking-models-for-better-search), re-ranking models are new to the scene of zero-shot generalization. The story of re-rankers has mostly been tabular user features combined with tabular product or item features, fed to XGBoost models. This required a significant amount of user data to achieve, which zero-shot generalization may stand to disrupt. Cross encoders have gained popularity by taking as input a `(query, document)` pair and outputting a high precision relevance score. This can be easily generalized to recommendation as well, in which the ranker takes as input a `(user description, item description)` pair.»\\n[5] «In the future, we expect further optionality ablating the capacity of the model due to inherent trade-offs of performance and latency that may make sense for some applications but not others. Discovering jointly which capacity re-ranker is needed and how many retrieved results to re-rank is another challenge for tuning the knobs in retrieval. This is also one of the lowest hanging fruit opportunities for fine-tuning custom models in the RAG stack, which we will discuss further in “Tuning Orchestration”. Another interesting knob to tune is Multi-Index Search. Similar to our discussion on chunking, this is a tricky one that may involve structural changes to the database.»\\n\\nQuestion: How will Long Context LLMs impact re-ranker models?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Answer: The provided context does not discuss the impact of Long Context LLMs on re-ranker models.
