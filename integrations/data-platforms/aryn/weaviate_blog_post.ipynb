    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "To run this notebook, you should complete the following setup tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sycamore**. The Sycamore library can be installed using `pip` with the command `pip install sycamore-ai`. We recommend you install this in a virtual environment to isolate its dependencies.\n",
    "- **ArynPartitioner**. This notebook utilizes the Aryn Partitioning Service. This provides an endpoint that integrates with Sycamore for partitioning PDFs. You can sign up for a free API key at [https://www.aryn.ai/get-started](https://www.aryn.ai/get-started). Once you have gotten an API key, export it by setting the `ARYN_API_KEY` environment variable. You can read about other options to specify your API key [here](https://sycamore.readthedocs.io/en/stable/aryn_cloud/aryn_partitioning_service.html). Alternatively, you can run the partitioning step locally, as described below. \n",
    "- **Poppler**. Some of Sycamore's PDF processing routines depend on the `poppler` package being available. This can be installed with your platform's native package manager. For example, on Mac with Homebrew, you can install it with `brew install poppler` and on Debian Linux and it's derivatives you can use `sudo apt install poppler-utils`. More information about Poppler can be found [here](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/).\n",
    "- **OpenAI**. The `SummarizeImages` transform makes use of OpenAI to compute text summaries of images. To make use of OpenAI, you need an OpenAI API key, which you can get from [here](https://platform.openai.com). This notebook assumes you have set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set to your key, though we show below how to set the key directly as well. \n",
    "- **Weaviate**. Weaviate should be accessible via localhost on port 8080 for HTTP and port 50051 for gRPC. To support embedding of queries, you should have the `sentence-transformers-all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model setup. You can find a sample Docker compose file to set this up [here](https://github.com/aryn-ai/sycamore/blob/main/apps/weaviate/compose.yml)."
