Excerpts that provide a comprehensive overview of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its role in grounding LLM outputs in external sources directly support the first pillar.

Several passages explicitly discuss LLM-powered search capabilities that synthesize information across multiple web sources to provide cohesive answers with citations, aligning with the second pillar. For example, descriptions of embedding retrieval, context grounding, and the use of external knowledge bases to answer with grounded, source-backed responses illustrate how LLMs can act as search-oriented systems rather than mere question-answerers. Additional excerpts discuss agentic RAG and browsing-style capabilities where the LLMs plan, query, and retrieve information dynamically, enabling multi-step, tool-augmented workflows that resemble autonomous browsing agents. This triad is complemented by industry- and academia-focused discussions about safety, robustness, and evaluation of RAG-enabled web search, including how sources are used to ground outputs and how reformulation and self-critique mechanisms are used to improve reliability, all of which reinforce the third pillar around browsing agents/tools and real-time web grounding.

Several excerpts name or describe CRAG, its decomposition/recomposition strategy, and its goal of robustness to incorrect retrieval, which supports the CRAG item in the field value. Excerpts about GraphRAG and HyperGraphRAG describe using knowledge graphs to structure retrieval and enhance reasoning with graph-based representations, directly supporting the GraphRAG portion. References to Multimodal RAG (e.g., SAM-RAG, OmniSearch) show retrieval-augmented methods that handle non-text data and multi-hop reasoning, aligning with Multimodal RAG. Passages discussing RECOMP describe a compression technique that condenses retrieved content to reduce load on the LLM, matching the RECOMP item. Excerpts mentioning RAGAS cover evaluation metrics for grounding and contextual relevance, supporting the RAGAS entry. MS-RAG passages describe a multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense and sparse methods with RL optimization, which matches the MS-RAG item. SafeRAG passages introduce a security benchmark for RAG pipelines and attack taxonomies, which aligns with the SafeRAG item. Finally, broader discussions of CoRAG, Reactive/RAG evolution, and agentic retrieval contexts provide context linking these techniques into the modern agentic RAG landscape, supporting all listed techniques through concrete definitions and examples.', citations=[Citation(url='https://blog.nashtechglobal.com/evolution-of-rag-from-static-knowledge-to-agentic-reasoning/', excerpts=[' Self-RAG (Self-Reflective RAG) – Late 2023\\n\\n', ' Agentic RAG signifies the key industry shift from relatively static retrieval augmentation to autonomous, self-directed retrieval and reasoning, though it necessitates addressing new challenges in reliability, evaluation, and ethical governance.

Broader reviews of RAG architectures that trace the evolution and improvements in RAG paradigms provide context that such improvements are part of ongoing efforts to reduce hallucinations and improve data quality, though they do not make explicit claims about token efficiency or inference-time reductions. A specific mention of decomposition/recombination of documents focuses on data quality and succinctness which touches on efficient data handling, while general evolution discussions (Self-RAG) provide context but are less directly tied to the precise benefits in the field value. Overall, the strongest signals come from explicit claims of improved accuracy and corrective retrieval strategies, with supporting context on robustness and adaptive retrieval strategies; direct evidence about reduced token usage and inference time is not clearly stated in the excerpts.

This period saw a paradigm shift from static information retrieval to dynamic, agentic reasoning. RAG architectures evolved from basic retrieval to advanced, self-correcting, and adaptive systems like Self-RAG and CRAG, which learn to critique and refine retrieved information. The introduction of GraphRAG and multimodal RAG (e.g., OmniSearch) further expanded capabilities to handle structured and non-textual data. Concurrently, 2025 was widely recognized as the 'year of agents,' marked by a surge in research using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train LLMs to autonomously plan, use tools (including web search), and synthesize information (e.g., R1-Searcher, Search-R1). Major industry players like Google (AI Overviews) and Microsoft (Copilot) integrated LLMs into their search products, leading to a 'zero-click' future and significant impacts on the publisher ecosystem. This progress was paralleled by the development of sophisticated benchmarks to address critical challenges like factuality (FACTS Grounding), long-document reasoning (SummHay, LiveResearchBench), and security (SafeRAG), revealing both the advanced capabilities and persistent weaknesses of state-of-the-art models. Architectural trends toward longer context windows, multimodality, and more efficient models (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts) have provided the foundation for these advancements, though open problems related to evaluation, security, bias, and the cognitive impact on users remain active areas of investigation.\", 'clarification_of_scope': \"For the purpose of this report, the term 'web search for LLMs' is interpreted as a broad and evolving field encompassing three interconnected pillars. This interpretation is based on the consensus in recent academic literature and market trends, which see these areas converging. The three pillars are: 1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** This refers to the family of techniques where LLMs are connected to external knowledge sources, including web content, to ground their responses in factual, up-to-date information. This is a foundational method for mitigating hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, and providing answers based on proprietary or real-time data. The scope includes the evolution from basic RAG to advanced, modular, and agentic RAG systems. 2. **LLM-powered Search Engines:** This pillar covers the integration of LLMs into the core functionality of search engines. It represents a shift from traditional keyword-based ranked lists to conversational, generative search experiences where the LLM synthesizes information from multiple web sources to provide a single, coherent answer, often with citations. Examples include Google's AI Overviews and Microsoft Copilot's web grounding. 3. **LLM Browsing Agents/Tools:** This refers to LLMs that act as autonomous or semi-autonomous agents capable of interacting with the web. These agents can perform multi-step tasks, navigate websites, use various tools (e.g., search APIs, calculators), and extract and synthesize information to fulfill complex user requests. Research in this area focuses on planning, tool-use protocols, and training agents with methods like Reinforcement Learning. The research indicates a significant blurring of lines, where advanced RAG systems become agentic and LLM-powered search engines incorporate agent-like capabilities.\", 'timeline_of_milestones': [{'year': 2023.0, 'period': 'Q3-Q4', 'milestone_description': 'Introduction of a reference-free suite of metrics for the automated evaluation of RAG system quality across multiple dimensions, including faithfulness and answer relevance.', 'category': 'Benchmark', 'associated_work': 'RAGAS'}, {'year': 2023.0, 'period': 'October', 'milestone_description': 'A seminal paper introducing a framework where an LLM learns to retrieve on-demand and critique its own generations to enhance quality and factuality, reducing hallucinations.', 'category': 'Paper', 'associated_work': 'Self-RAG'}, {'year': 2023.0, 'period': 'December', 'milestone_description': \"Launch of Google's next-generation multimodal model, which would become the core technology for its AI-powered search features.\", 'category': 'Model Release', 'associated_work': 'Google Gemini'}, {'year': 2024.0, 'period': 'January', 'milestone_description': 'A paper proposing a RAG method that enhances robustness with a self-correcting retriever that assesses retrieval quality and triggers web searches for self-correction.', 'category': 'Paper', 'associated_work': 'Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG)'}, {'year': 2024.0, 'period': 'May', 'milestone_description': 'Meta introduces a challenging benchmark for General AI Assistants, featuring complex, multi-step problems requiring tool use, including web browsing.', 'category': 'Benchmark', 'associated_work': 'GAIA Benchmark'}, {'year': 2024.0, 'period': 'May', 'milestone_description': 'Google begins rolling out its generative search experience, powered by the Gemini model, to all users in the U.S., marking a major shift in consumer search.', 'category': 'Industry Launch', 'associated_work': 'Google AI Overviews'}, {'year': 2024.0, 'period': 'December', 'milestone_description': 'Google DeepMind and Kaggle release a benchmark to evaluate how accurately LLMs ground their responses in provided source documents and avoid hallucinations.', 'category': 'Benchmark', 'associated_work': 'FACTS Grounding Benchmark'}, {'year': 2025.0, 'period': 'Q1', 'milestone_description': 'A series of papers are released focusing on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train LLMs to effectively leverage search engines and reason with search results.', 'category': 'Paper', 'associated_work': 'R1-Searcher, Search-R1, ReSearch'}, {'year': 2025.0, 'period': 'Q1', 'milestone_description': 'Introduction of the first security-focused benchmark for RAG pipelines, cataloging attack classes and evaluating the vulnerability of existing systems.', 'category': 'Benchmark', 'associated_work': 'SafeRAG'}, {'year': 2025.0, 'period': 'Q2', 'milestone_description': \"Launch of a comprehensive evaluation suite for 'deep research' tasks, assessing agents on their ability to iteratively seek, validate, and integrate evidence from the web.\", 'category': 'Benchmark', 'associated_work': 'LiveResearchBench and DeepEval'}, {'year': 2025.0, 'period': 'Mid', 'milestone_description': \"The discourse in the research community notably shifts from traditional RAG towards 'Agentic RAG,' where autonomous agents plan and execute complex retrieval and reasoning workflows.\", 'category': 'Research Trend', 'associated_work': 'Agentic RAG'}, {'year': 2025.0, 'period': 'September', 'milestone_description': 'An academic study raises concerns that LLM-generated summaries, despite being linked to web sources, may lead to shallower knowledge and less original thought compared to traditional search.', 'category': 'Paper', 'associated_work': 'Study on Learning Depth'}], 'rag_advancements_analysis': \"The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from late 2023 to late 2025 marks a significant progression from a simple retrieval-and-generation pipeline to highly sophisticated, modular, and agentic systems. This evolution reflects a deeper integration of reasoning, self-correction, and autonomous decision-making into the retrieval process, fundamentally transforming how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with external knowledge.\\n\\n1.  **Basic RAG (Pre-2023):** The foundational RAG architecture, as introduced by Lewis et al. in 2020, involves a straightforward three-step process: indexing a knowledge base, retrieving relevant documents based on a user query, and feeding these documents as context to an LLM for answer generation. This approach was widely adopted by 2023 to mitigate hallucinations and update the factual knowledge of LLMs. While easy and cheap to implement with low latency, Basic RAG suffered from several limitations, including low precision due to irrelevant retrieved chunks, the 'lost-in-the-middle' problem where information in the middle of a long context is ignored, and difficulty in answering questions that require synthesizing information from multiple sources.\\n\\n2.  **Advanced and Modular RAG (Late 2023 - 2024):** The period saw a shift towards more sophisticated RAG architectures. A 2024 taxonomy distinguished between Naive RAG, Advanced RAG (with pre-retrieval and post-retrieval enhancements like reranking), and Modular RAG. Modular RAG, as conceptualized by Gao et al. in late 2023, treats the RAG pipeline as a flexible toolkit of interchangeable components. This allows for highly optimized, use-case-specific workflows by incorporating modules for query transformation, routing, and advanced retrieval strategies. This phase also saw the rise of retriever-centric (e.g., optimizing chunking, reranking) and generator-centric (e.g., iterative reasoning) designs. While offering greater flexibility and performance, Modular RAG introduced significant engineering complexity and debugging challenges.\\n\\n3.  **Self-Correcting and Active RAG (Late 2023 - 2024):** This stage introduced more intelligence into the retrieval process. Techniques like **SELF-RAG** (late 2023) empowered the LLM to perform self-critique during both retrieval and generation. It learns to generate 'reflection tokens' that trigger on-demand retrieval and assess the relevance of retrieved passages, making the process adaptive. Similarly, **Corrective RAG (CRAG)** (Jan 2024) introduced a lightweight retrieval evaluator to assess the quality of retrieved documents and trigger corrective actions, such as web searches, if the information is deemed incorrect or ambiguous. These approaches significantly enhanced the factuality and robustness of RAG systems by actively mitigating the impact of irrelevant or misleading context.\\n\\n4.  **Agentic RAG (Late 2024 - 2025):** This represents the latest paradigm shift, where the RAG process is driven by an autonomous 'Agent'. An Agentic RAG system can plan a sequence of actions, including iterative querying, reading documents, using external tools (like calculators or code interpreters), and performing self-correction. This architecture integrates reflection, planning, and tool use, moving from a static retrieval pipeline to a dynamic, self-directed reasoning process. LlamaIndex identified this as a major trend for 2025, noting that it blurs the lines between RAG and agent platforms. Agentic RAG excels at solving complex, multi-step problems that require intelligent decision-making but comes at the cost of higher latency and token consumption due to the sequential nature of tool calls and the LLM's need to 'think' through its steps. This evolution is also tied to the concept of 'Context Engineering' or 'RAG 2.0', which focuses on strategically filling the context window with the most relevant information at each step of an agent's trajectory.\", 'specific_rag_techniques': [{'technique_name': 'SELF-RAG', 'year_introduced': 2023.0, 'core_concept': \"An LLM is trained to generate special 'reflection' tokens that enable it to perform on-demand retrieval and self-critique.

This progression, often termed 'Agentic Deep Research' or 'Agentic Reinforcement Learning' (Agentic RL), has been driven by advancements in reinforcement learning, the formalization of tool-use protocols, and the development of sophisticated multi-step reasoning capabilities, effectively blurring the lines between search engines and autonomous agents.\\n\\nThe core of this evolution lies in moving beyond supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to training methods that enable agents to perceive, reason, plan, and adapt in dynamic web environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been the key enabler. Instead of just predicting the next token, agents are trained to take actions (like issuing a search query or clicking a link) to maximize a reward. These rewards are increasingly sophisticated:\\n\\n1.  **Reinforcement Learning on Search Outcomes:** Early methods used simple rewards, but by 2025, systems began using complex, outcome-based rewards. For example, agents are rewarded based on the final accuracy or completeness of their answer, incentivizing them to learn effective, multi-step search strategies. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) variants became a common strategy, used in systems like R1-Searcher to first learn *when* to search and then *how* to use the results. Other approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are used to align agent behavior with human feedback, as seen in WebThinker, which tackles complex report generation.\\n\\n2.  **Simulated Feedback and Self-Play:** A significant challenge in training with live web search is the high cost of API calls and the instability caused by noisy, real-world data. To mitigate this, researchers developed methods using simulated environments. Systems like ZeroSearch and SSRL (Self-Supervised RL) employ offline 'self-search' during training, where the agent interacts with a pseudo search engine distilled from other LLMs. This enhances training efficiency, stability, and controllability while reducing reliance on costly real-time APIs.\\n\\n3.  **Tool-Use Protocols and Multi-Step Reasoning:** The ability of agents to use tools is central to their evolution. The ReAct (Reason + Act) architecture, which involves a loop of thought, action, and observation, became a foundational protocol for enabling agents to iteratively solve tasks. This allows agents to perform complex, multi-step research processes that involve planning, issuing multiple search queries, consulting documents, and even collaborating with other specialized agents.

The most profound effect is the acceleration of the 'zero-click' phenomenon. By providing synthesized, direct answers at the top of the search results page, these systems reduce the user's need to click through to source websites. This has led to substantial traffic displacement for publishers who rely on search referral traffic for revenue and audience engagement. \\n\\nEmpirical data from the initial rollout of Google's AI Overviews in 2024 highlighted the severity of this impact, with publishers reporting a significant '40-60% drop in click-through rates from AI summaries'. This has raised existential concerns for the content ecosystem, as it directly affects advertising revenue and the viability of many online publications. The economic model of the ad-funded internet is further challenged by the rise of agentic search, which, as of November 2025, is noted to be 'generating massive web traffic without ad revenue'. While this shift benefits users with quick answers and search engine providers with increased engagement, it threatens the symbiotic relationship between search engines and content creators. Interestingly, Google has countered these concerns, claiming that links within AI Overviews actually receive more clicks than traditional web listings for the same queries and that the feature encourages visits to a 'greater diversity of websites', especially for complex questions. The financial upside for search providers is substantial; Morgan Stanley projects that for every 10% of search queries handled by AI, Google could see an additional $1.2 billion in annual revenue, potentially reaching $12 billion if 50% of queries are AI-processed.\\n\\nIn response to this new paradigm, a necessary and rapid shift in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and content strategies is underway. To remain visible and relevant to LLM-powered search crawlers and synthesizers, brands and publishers are advised to adapt their strategies. This includes a greater emphasis on structured data through 'schema markup', providing 'real-time updates', creating comprehensive 'FAQs', and incorporating rich 'multimedia content'. The goal is to create content that is easily digestible and valuable for AI synthesis, thereby increasing the chances of being featured and cited in AI-generated answers. The impact, however, is not uniform. Enterprise-focused systems like Microsoft Copilot, which use web grounding primarily for internal business intelligence within a secure and private framework, have a less pronounced direct impact on the public SEO ecosystem compared to broad, consumer-facing systems like Google's AI Overviews.\", 'user_experience_and_cognitive_impacts': \"The rise of generative search, powered by LLMs, has fundamentally altered the user experience (UX) of information retrieval and raises significant questions about its long-term cognitive impacts. The primary UX shift is from the traditional paradigm of a ranked list of blue links, which requires users to click, evaluate, and synthesize information from multiple sources, to a more direct, conversational model that provides a single, synthesized answer. Systems like Google's AI Overviews and ChatGPT Search, which by early 2025 were considered 'genuinely useful' after overcoming earlier hallucination issues, exemplify this change.\\n\\nFrom a user experience perspective, this shift has been largely positive. Research indicates that for Google's AI Overviews, 'users reported increased satisfaction and more frequent use of Search'. The feature is particularly valued for its ability to handle complex questions that would have traditionally required multiple searches, effectively 'streamlining the information retrieval process' and reducing user effort. The user experience is set to become even more personalized, with planned features for Google's Search Labs allowing users to 'adjust the overview's language for simplicity or greater detail'. Furthermore, Google is testing a full-screen 'AI Mode' powered by Gemini, which offers a fully conversational search experience that prioritizes detailed responses over link lists, representing a deeper commitment to this new paradigm. In the enterprise space, systems like Microsoft Copilot enhance productivity by providing contextually relevant answers, while also giving users control, such as the ability to toggle web grounding on or off.\\n\\nHowever, this streamlined consumption of pre-synthesized information has prompted serious concerns about the cognitive impacts on users. An academic study from September 2025 suggests that LLM summaries, by their very nature, 'might lead to shallower knowledge and less original thought compared to traditional web search'. The cognitive effort of seeking out, comparing, and synthesizing information from various sources, while more laborious, is integral to deep learning and critical thinking. By offloading this process to an AI, there is a risk that users may engage less critically with information, potentially hindering their ability to form nuanced perspectives and develop their own insights. This raises profound questions about the long-term effects of generative search on information literacy, learning depth, and the development of critical thinking skills in the general population, representing a critical tradeoff between convenience and cognitive engagement.\", 'open_problems_and_future_research_directions': \"The rapid advancements in LLM-powered web search from late 2023 to 2025 have surfaced a multitude of complex open problems and defined clear future research directions that will shape the next generation of information access.\\n\\n**1. Evaluation of Complex Reasoning and Generative Search:**\\nA primary challenge is the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics. Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) benchmarks are designed for ranked lists of documents, not for the single, synthesized, long-form answers produced by generative search. Future research must develop new evaluation criteria and benchmarks that can assess the quality, coherence, factuality, and attribution of these generative outputs. Furthermore, current benchmarks like CURIE, SummHay, and LiveResearchBench reveal that even state-of-the-art models struggle with reasoning across long scientific documents, complex multi-hop queries, and deep research tasks. Overcoming weaknesses in current evaluation frameworks, such as data contamination, LLM evaluator bias, and high latency, is also a critical research direction.\\n\\n**2. Security, Robustness, and Privacy:**\\nThe integration of external web content via RAG and agentic browsing introduces significant security vulnerabilities. A key area for future research is defending against a new class of threats. The SafeRAG benchmark (2025) revealed that RAG systems are vulnerable to attacks like 'silver noise' (partially correct evidence), 'inter-context conflict', and 'soft ad attacks' that can bypass existing guardrails. Open problems include:\\n*   **Privacy-Preserving RAG:** Developing robust techniques like retriever-level differential privacy, encrypted search indices, and federated retrieval to prevent the leakage of sensitive information from retrieval databases or user queries.\\n*   **Retrieval and Data Poisoning:** Creating methods to harden retrievers against poisoned indices and adversarial web content designed to manipulate model behavior.\\n*   **Agentic Security:** Securing autonomous agents from prompt injections, unsafe tool actions, and other exploits that could lead to unauthorized data access or harmful outcomes. This includes developing secure sandboxed browsing environments.\\n\\n**3. Factuality, Hallucination, and Bias:**\\nDespite improvements, ensuring factual accuracy remains a paramount challenge. Even advanced models like Google's Gemini have shown high hallucination rates (e.g., 76.7% in high-stakes financial referencing tasks) in practice. Agentic systems introduce new failure modes like 'Action Hallucinations' (fabricating information in tool calls). Future research must focus on:\\n*   **Robust Grounding and Citation:** Improving the reliability of citations and ensuring that generated claims are strictly supported by retrieved evidence.\\n*   **Mitigating Bias:** Developing methods to control for and mitigate demographic and other biases present in both the LLM's training data and the retrieved web content. This includes research into bias-controlled embeddings and query rewriting techniques.\\n*   **Handling Noisy and Misleading Context:** Enhancing the ability of RAG systems to identify and discard irrelevant, outdated, or intentionally misleading information retrieved from the web.\\n\\n**4. Performance, Cost, and Scalability:**\\nThe computational cost and latency of advanced RAG and agentic systems are significant barriers to widespread, real-time deployment. Open problems include:\\n*   **Efficient Long-Context Handling:** Addressing the 'lost-in-the-middle' problem where models overlook key details in long context windows and reducing the high computational cost associated with them.\\n*   **Optimized Architectures:** Research into methods like KV-cache reuse and sparse attention to reduce inference costs, and improving their effectiveness for RAG on lengthy documents.\\n*   **Scalable Systems:** Designing architectures and accessible tooling that allow for the efficient deployment, maintenance, and scaling of RAG and agentic search systems.\\n\\n**5. Long-Term Societal and Cognitive Impact:**\\nPerhaps the most profound open questions relate to the broader societal impact of this technology. A critical area for academic inquiry is the long-term effect on user cognition. As identified in a 2025 study, the shift to pre-synthesized answers may lead to 'shallower knowledge and less original thought'. Research is urgently needed to understand and potentially mitigate these impacts on learning, critical thinking, and information literacy.

      "Academic research in web search for Large Language Models (LLMs) from late 2023 to late 2025 has been characterized by rapid evolution and the convergence of three core areas: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM-powered search engines, and autonomous LLM agents. This period saw a paradigm shift from static information retrieval to dynamic, agentic reasoning. RAG architectures evolved from basic retrieval to advanced, self-correcting, and adaptive systems like Self-RAG and CRAG, which learn to critique and refine retrieved information. The introduction of GraphRAG and multimodal RAG (e.g., OmniSearch) further expanded capabilities to handle structured and non-textual data. Concurrently, 2025 was widely recognized as the 'year of agents,' marked by a surge in research using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train LLMs to autonomously plan, use tools (including web search), and synthesize information (e.g., R1-Searcher, Search-R1). Major industry players like Google (AI Overviews) and Microsoft (Copilot) integrated LLMs into their search products, leading to a 'zero-click' future and significant impacts on the publisher ecosystem. This progress was paralleled by the development of sophisticated benchmarks to address critical challenges like factuality (FACTS Grounding), long-document reasoning (SummHay, LiveResearchBench), and security (SafeRAG), revealing both the advanced capabilities and persistent weaknesses of state-of-the-art models. Architectural trends toward longer context windows, multimodality, and more efficient models (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts) have provided the foundation for these advancements, though open problems related to evaluation, security, bias, and the cognitive impact on users remain active areas of investigation.\n",

      "clarification_of_scope:\n",
      "For the purpose of this report, the term 'web search for LLMs' is interpreted as a broad and evolving field encompassing three interconnected pillars. This interpretation is based on the consensus in recent academic literature and market trends, which see these areas converging. The three pillars are: 1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** This refers to the family of techniques where LLMs are connected to external knowledge sources, including web content, to ground their responses in factual, up-to-date information. This is a foundational method for mitigating hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, and providing answers based on proprietary or real-time data. The scope includes the evolution from basic RAG to advanced, modular, and agentic RAG systems. 2. **LLM-powered Search Engines:** This pillar covers the integration of LLMs into the core functionality of search engines. It represents a shift from traditional keyword-based ranked lists to conversational, generative search experiences where the LLM synthesizes information from multiple web sources to provide a single, coherent answer, often with citations. Examples include Google's AI Overviews and Microsoft Copilot's web grounding. 3. **LLM Browsing Agents/Tools:** This refers to LLMs that act as autonomous or semi-autonomous agents capable of interacting with the web. These agents can perform multi-step tasks, navigate websites, use various tools (e.g., search APIs, calculators), and extract and synthesize information to fulfill complex user requests. Research in this area focuses on planning, tool-use protocols, and training agents with methods like Reinforcement Learning. The research indicates a significant blurring of lines, where advanced RAG systems become agentic and LLM-powered search engines incorporate agent-like capabilities.\n",

      "The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from late 2023 to late 2025 marks a significant progression from a simple retrieval-and-generation pipeline to highly sophisticated, modular, and agentic systems. This evolution reflects a deeper integration of reasoning, self-correction, and autonomous decision-making into the retrieval process, fundamentally transforming how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with external knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Basic RAG (Pre-2023):** The foundational RAG architecture, as introduced by Lewis et al. in 2020, involves a straightforward three-step process: indexing a knowledge base, retrieving relevant documents based on a user query, and feeding these documents as context to an LLM for answer generation. This approach was widely adopted by 2023 to mitigate hallucinations and update the factual knowledge of LLMs. While easy and cheap to implement with low latency, Basic RAG suffered from several limitations, including low precision due to irrelevant retrieved chunks, the 'lost-in-the-middle' problem where information in the middle of a long context is ignored, and difficulty in answering questions that require synthesizing information from multiple sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Advanced and Modular RAG (Late 2023 - 2024):** The period saw a shift towards more sophisticated RAG architectures. A 2024 taxonomy distinguished between Naive RAG, Advanced RAG (with pre-retrieval and post-retrieval enhancements like reranking), and Modular RAG. Modular RAG, as conceptualized by Gao et al. in late 2023, treats the RAG pipeline as a flexible toolkit of interchangeable components. This allows for highly optimized, use-case-specific workflows by incorporating modules for query transformation, routing, and advanced retrieval strategies. This phase also saw the rise of retriever-centric (e.g., optimizing chunking, reranking) and generator-centric (e.g., iterative reasoning) designs. While offering greater flexibility and performance, Modular RAG introduced significant engineering complexity and debugging challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Self-Correcting and Active RAG (Late 2023 - 2024):** This stage introduced more intelligence into the retrieval process. Techniques like **SELF-RAG** (late 2023) empowered the LLM to perform self-critique during both retrieval and generation. It learns to generate 'reflection tokens' that trigger on-demand retrieval and assess the relevance of retrieved passages, making the process adaptive. Similarly, **Corrective RAG (CRAG)** (Jan 2024) introduced a lightweight retrieval evaluator to assess the quality of retrieved documents and trigger corrective actions, such as web searches, if the information is deemed incorrect or ambiguous. These approaches significantly enhanced the factuality and robustness of RAG systems by actively mitigating the impact of irrelevant or misleading context.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Agentic RAG (Late 2024 - 2025):** This represents the latest paradigm shift, where the RAG process is driven by an autonomous 'Agent'. An Agentic RAG system can plan a sequence of actions, including iterative querying, reading documents, using external tools (like calculators or code interpreters), and performing self-correction. This architecture integrates reflection, planning, and tool use, moving from a static retrieval pipeline to a dynamic, self-directed reasoning process. LlamaIndex identified this as a major trend for 2025, noting that it blurs the lines between RAG and agent platforms. Agentic RAG excels at solving complex, multi-step problems that require intelligent decision-making but comes at the cost of higher latency and token consumption due to the sequential nature of tool calls and the LLM's need to 'think' through its steps. This evolution is also tied to the concept of 'Context Engineering' or 'RAG 2.0', which focuses on strategically filling the context window with the most relevant information at each step of an agent's trajectory.\n",

      "The evolution of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) for web search between late 2023 and late 2025 represents a fundamental paradigm shift from passive information retrieval to active, autonomous problem-solving. This progression, often termed 'Agentic Deep Research' or 'Agentic Reinforcement Learning' (Agentic RL), has been driven by advancements in reinforcement learning, the formalization of tool-use protocols, and the development of sophisticated multi-step reasoning capabilities, effectively blurring the lines between search engines and autonomous agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of this evolution lies in moving beyond supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to training methods that enable agents to perceive, reason, plan, and adapt in dynamic web environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been the key enabler. Instead of just predicting the next token, agents are trained to take actions (like issuing a search query or clicking a link) to maximize a reward. These rewards are increasingly sophisticated:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Reinforcement Learning on Search Outcomes:** Early methods used simple rewards, but by 2025, systems began using complex, outcome-based rewards. For example, agents are rewarded based on the final accuracy or completeness of their answer, incentivizing them to learn effective, multi-step search strategies. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) variants became a common strategy, used in systems like R1-Searcher to first learn *when* to search and then *how* to use the results. Other approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are used to align agent behavior with human feedback, as seen in WebThinker, which tackles complex report generation.\n",

      "2.  **Simulated Feedback and Self-Play:** A significant challenge in training with live web search is the high cost of API calls and the instability caused by noisy, real-world data. To mitigate this, researchers developed methods using simulated environments. Systems like ZeroSearch and SSRL (Self-Supervised RL) employ offline 'self-search' during training, where the agent interacts with a pseudo search engine distilled from other LLMs. This enhances training efficiency, stability, and controllability while reducing reliance on costly real-time APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Tool-Use Protocols and Multi-Step Reasoning:** The ability of agents to use tools is central to their evolution. The ReAct (Reason + Act) architecture, which involves a loop of thought, action, and observation, became a foundational protocol for enabling agents to iteratively solve tasks. This allows agents to perform complex, multi-step research processes that involve planning, issuing multiple search queries, consulting documents, and even collaborating with other specialized agents. Agents learn to reformulate queries based on initial findings, demonstrating a dynamic understanding of the information-seeking process. Protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have also been proposed to improve quality by separating web search functionalities from the LLM's core reasoning 'brain', allowing for more specialized and reliable tool use.\n",

      "This evolution has created autonomous search agents capable of in-depth analysis, synthesizing insights, and drafting comprehensive reports. However, it also introduces new challenges, including 'action hallucinations' (fabricating tool call information), getting stuck in repetitive loops, and the critical need for robust safety guardrails and human oversight to manage the risks of live, autonomous web browsing.\n",

This represents a fundamental shift from the traditional web search model, which presents users with a ranked list of independent web pages. In contrast, generative search engines like Google's AI Overviews, Microsoft Copilot, and ChatGPT Search leverage LLMs to retrieve information from a wide array of web pages and then synthesize this data into a single, coherent, conversational text response. This approach aims to provide direct, synthesized answers, often with citations, thereby reducing the user's need to click through multiple links. This trend is leading towards a 'zero-click' future, which has significant implications for publishers and the SEO ecosystem, as it can drastically reduce referral traffic. Academic research from 2025 characterizes this evolution, noting that while early 2023 versions were often plagued by hallucinations, by 2025, major platforms have become genuinely useful and more reliable. Beyond just generating answers, LLMs are also being employed for more nuanced search tasks, including advanced query understanding, re-ranking search results, and proactively generating clarifying questions to better understand user intent.

Instead of a static, one-shot retrieval process, an Agentic RAG system can dynamically query data sources, use external tools (like calculators, code interpreters, or SQL databases), read and synthesize results, re-query based on new information, and self-correct its approach. This approach integrates core agentic capabilities such as reflection, planning, tool use, and even collaboration with other agents, blurring the lines between RAG and autonomous agent platforms.

For agentic browsing, it allows the LLM to not just find information but to act on it, performing tasks like booking flights, analyzing market data from multiple financial sites, or conducting deep research by autonomously navigating the web.

Each step in the agent's reasoning process often requires a separate call to the LLM, leading to a substantial increase in total token consumption and, consequently, higher computational costs.

      "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into web search, particularly through features like Google's AI Overviews, has triggered significant and disruptive impacts on the digital market and publisher ecosystem between late 2023 and 2025. The most profound effect is the acceleration of the 'zero-click' phenomenon. By providing synthesized, direct answers at the top of the search results page, these systems reduce the user's need to click through to source websites. This has led to substantial traffic displacement for publishers who rely on search referral traffic for revenue and audience engagement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Empirical data from the initial rollout of Google's AI Overviews in 2024 highlighted the severity of this impact, with publishers reporting a significant '40-60% drop in click-through rates from AI summaries'. This has raised existential concerns for the content ecosystem, as it directly affects advertising revenue and the viability of many online publications. The economic model of the ad-funded internet is further challenged by the rise of agentic search, which, as of November 2025, is noted to be 'generating massive web traffic without ad revenue'. While this shift benefits users with quick answers and search engine providers with increased engagement, it threatens the symbiotic relationship between search engines and content creators. Interestingly, Google has countered these concerns, claiming that links within AI Overviews actually receive more clicks than traditional web listings for the same queries and that the feature encourages visits to a 'greater diversity of websites', especially for complex questions. The financial upside for search providers is substantial; Morgan Stanley projects that for every 10% of search queries handled by AI, Google could see an additional $1.2 billion in annual revenue, potentially reaching $12 billion if 50% of queries are AI-processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to this new paradigm, a necessary and rapid shift in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and content strategies is underway. To remain visible and relevant to LLM-powered search crawlers and synthesizers, brands and publishers are advised to adapt their strategies. This includes a greater emphasis on structured data through 'schema markup', providing 'real-time updates', creating comprehensive 'FAQs', and incorporating rich 'multimedia content'. The goal is to create content that is easily digestible and valuable for AI synthesis, thereby increasing the chances of being featured and cited in AI-generated answers. The impact, however, is not uniform. Enterprise-focused systems like Microsoft Copilot, which use web grounding primarily for internal business intelligence within a secure and private framework, have a less pronounced direct impact on the public SEO ecosystem compared to broad, consumer-facing systems like Google's AI Overviews.\n",

      "user_experience_and_cognitive_impacts:\n",
      "The rise of generative search, powered by LLMs, has fundamentally altered the user experience (UX) of information retrieval and raises significant questions about its long-term cognitive impacts. The primary UX shift is from the traditional paradigm of a ranked list of blue links, which requires users to click, evaluate, and synthesize information from multiple sources, to a more direct, conversational model that provides a single, synthesized answer. Systems like Google's AI Overviews and ChatGPT Search, which by early 2025 were considered 'genuinely useful' after overcoming earlier hallucination issues, exemplify this change.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a user experience perspective, this shift has been largely positive. Research indicates that for Google's AI Overviews, 'users reported increased satisfaction and more frequent use of Search'. The feature is particularly valued for its ability to handle complex questions that would have traditionally required multiple searches, effectively 'streamlining the information retrieval process' and reducing user effort. The user experience is set to become even more personalized, with planned features for Google's Search Labs allowing users to 'adjust the overview's language for simplicity or greater detail'. Furthermore, Google is testing a full-screen 'AI Mode' powered by Gemini, which offers a fully conversational search experience that prioritizes detailed responses over link lists, representing a deeper commitment to this new paradigm. In the enterprise space, systems like Microsoft Copilot enhance productivity by providing contextually relevant answers, while also giving users control, such as the ability to toggle web grounding on or off.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this streamlined consumption of pre-synthesized information has prompted serious concerns about the cognitive impacts on users. An academic study from September 2025 suggests that LLM summaries, by their very nature, 'might lead to shallower knowledge and less original thought compared to traditional web search'. The cognitive effort of seeking out, comparing, and synthesizing information from various sources, while more laborious, is integral to deep learning and critical thinking. By offloading this process to an AI, there is a risk that users may engage less critically with information, potentially hindering their ability to form nuanced perspectives and develop their own insights. This raises profound questions about the long-term effects of generative search on information literacy, learning depth, and the development of critical thinking skills in the general population, representing a critical tradeoff between convenience and cognitive engagement.\n",

      "*   **Privacy-Preserving RAG:** Developing robust techniques like retriever-level differential privacy, encrypted search indices, and federated retrieval to prevent the leakage of sensitive information from retrieval databases or user queries.\n",
      "*   **Retrieval and Data Poisoning:** Creating methods to harden retrievers against poisoned indices and adversarial web content designed to manipulate model behavior.\n",
      "*   **Agentic Security:** Securing autonomous agents from prompt injections, unsafe tool actions, and other exploits that could lead to unauthorized data access or harmful outcomes. This includes developing secure sandboxed browsing environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Factuality, Hallucination, and Bias:**\n",
      "Despite improvements, ensuring factual accuracy remains a paramount challenge. Even advanced models like Google's Gemini have shown high hallucination rates (e.g., 76.7% in high-stakes financial referencing tasks) in practice. Agentic systems introduce new failure modes like 'Action Hallucinations' (fabricating information in tool calls). Future research must focus on:\n",
      "*   **Robust Grounding and Citation:** Improving the reliability of citations and ensuring that generated claims are strictly supported by retrieved evidence.\n",
      "*   **Mitigating Bias:** Developing methods to control for and mitigate demographic and other biases present in both the LLM's training data and the retrieved web content. This includes research into bias-controlled embeddings and query rewriting techniques.\n",
      "*   **Handling Noisy and Misleading Context:** Enhancing the ability of RAG systems to identify and discard irrelevant, outdated, or intentionally misleading information retrieved from the web.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Performance, Cost, and Scalability:**\n",
      "The computational cost and latency of advanced RAG and agentic systems are significant barriers to widespread, real-time deployment. Open problems include:\n",
      "*   **Efficient Long-Context Handling:** Addressing the 'lost-in-the-middle' problem where models overlook key details in long context windows and reducing the high computational cost associated with them.\n",
      "*   **Optimized Architectures:** Research into methods like KV-cache reuse and sparse attention to reduce inference costs, and improving their effectiveness for RAG on lengthy documents.\n",
      "*   **Scalable Systems:** Designing architectures and accessible tooling that allow for the efficient deployment, maintenance, and scaling of RAG and agentic search systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Long-Term Societal and Cognitive Impact:**\n",
      "Perhaps the most profound open questions relate to the broader societal impact of this technology. A critical area for academic inquiry is the long-term effect on user cognition. As identified in a 2025 study, the shift to pre-synthesized answers may lead to 'shallower knowledge and less original thought'. Research is urgently needed to understand and potentially mitigate these impacts on learning, critical thinking, and information literacy. Additionally, the economic disruption to the publisher ecosystem and the ad-funded internet model requires further study to understand its long-term consequences and explore sustainable alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Multimodal and Advanced Reasoning Capabilities:**\n",
      "Future research will continue to push the boundaries of what LLM search can do. Key directions include:\n",
      "*   **Multimodal RAG:** Solving open challenges in multimodal RAG, such as effective cross-modal alignment and vision-aware reranking, to enable retrieval and reasoning over text, images, audio, and video.\n",
      "*   **Graph-Enhanced RAG (GraphRAG):** Integrating LLMs with auto-updating knowledge graphs to enhance context-aware, multi-hop reasoning and provide more structured, reliable knowledge.\n",

      "Recent advances in Information Retrieval (IR) applied to Web Search, especially in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) from late 2023 to 2025, reveal a transformative shift from traditional static retrieval toward dynamic, agentic reasoning and integration of generative AI techniques. The overlap of cutting-edge IR and Web Search is characterized by several key converging areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Evolution:**  \n",
      "   RAG systems combine LLMs with external knowledge sources, particularly web content, to ground responses in real-time, factual data. There has been a progression from basic retrieval models to modular, self-correcting, and agentic RAG systems. Key innovations include:  \n",
      "   - **Self-RAG:** LLMs learn to trigger on-demand retrieval and critique their own generations to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations.  \n",
      "   - **Corrective RAG (CRAG):** Incorporates retrieval quality evaluators that prompt corrective web searches when necessary.  \n",
      "   - **Agentic RAG:** Autonomous agents plan multi-step workflows, dynamically query data sources, use external tools, and self-correct iteratively, transcending static retrieval pipelines.  \n",
      "   - **GraphRAG and Multimodal RAG:** Integration of structured knowledge graphs and support for multi-modal data (images, video) enrich retrieval capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **LLM-Powered Search Engines:**  \n",
      "   Search engines like Google AI Overviews, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI ChatGPT integrate LLMs deeply to synthesize diverse web results into single, conversational answers. This generative search model moves away from ranked lists toward zero-click search experiences, providing users with synthesized summaries often with citations. This shift improves user satisfaction but disrupts traditional publisher traffic models.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Agentic LLMs and Autonomous Search Agents:**  \n",
      "   Reinforcement learning (RL) and techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization train LLMs to autonomously plan, issue queries, interpret retrieved information, and execute multi-step reasoning tasks. This ability transforms web search into an interactive, tool-using agent process capable of complex research and dynamic knowledge synthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Architectural Innovations and Benchmarks:**  \n",
      "   Advances include longer context windows (up to millions of tokens), more efficient models (like Mixture-of-Experts), and the creation of evaluation benchmarks (RAGAS, FACTS Grounding, LiveResearchBench, SafeRAG) that measure factuality, robustness, and security in retrieval-augmented systems. These benchmarks highlight both progress and persistent challenges such as hallucinations, citation reliability, robustness against attacks, and cognitive impact on users.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Security and Robustness:**  \n",
      "   The introduction of external web knowledge exposes new attack surfaces like data poisoning, prompting development of mitigation strategies such as domain whitelisting, content sanitization, sandboxed browsing for agents, and retriever-level differential privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **User Experience and Societal Impacts:**  \n",
      "   Generative search improves immediate usability and reduces user effort but may lead to shallower knowledge acquisition and reduced critical engagement by presenting pre-synthesized answers instead of diverse source exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the current cutting-edge in IR applied to web search centers on seamlessly blending advanced retrieval models with LLMs to enable interactive, accurate, and context-aware search experiences. These systems autonomously manage retrieval, reasoning, and multi-step tool use, while ongoing research focuses on enhancing factual accuracy, security, efficiency, and the holistic user impact of this paradigm shift.\n"
