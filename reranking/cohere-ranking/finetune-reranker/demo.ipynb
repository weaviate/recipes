In this article, we give you an overview of what Ref2Vec is and some examples in which it can add value such as recommendations or representing long objects. ## What is Ref2Vec? The name Ref2Vec is short for reference-to-vector, and it offers the ability to vectorize a data object with its cross-references to other objects. The Ref2Vec module currently holds the name ref2vec-**centroid** because it uses the average, or centroid vector, of the cross-referenced vectors to represent the **referencing** object.\"\n",

Another benefit of Ref2Vec is that this calculation is not compute-heavy, leading to low overhead. With Ref2Vec, you can use Weaviate to provide Recommendation with \\\"user-as-query\\\". This is a very common and powerful way to build Home Feed style features in apps. This can be done by sending queries like this to Weaviate:\\n\\n```graphql\\n{\\n  Get {\\n    Product (\\n      nearObject: {\\n        id: \\\"8abc5-4d5...\\\" # id for the User object with vector defined by ref2vec-centroid\\n      }\\n    ) {\\n      product_name\\n      price\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis short query encapsulates the power of Ref2Vec.\"\n",

In this article, we give you an overview of what Ref2Vec is and some examples in which it can add value such as recommendations or representing long objects. ## What is Ref2Vec? The name Ref2Vec is short for reference-to-vector, and it offers the ability to vectorize a data object with its cross-references to other objects. The Ref2Vec module currently holds the name ref2vec-**centroid** because it uses the average, or centroid vector, of the cross-referenced vectors to represent the **referencing** object.\"\n",
